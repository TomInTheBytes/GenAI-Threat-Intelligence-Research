Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor "Taidoor" has been identified as part of the APT group Earth Aughisky, with documented activity dating back to 2011. The group has targeted organizations primarily in Taiwan, with recent expansions to Japan observed towards the end of 2017. Earth Aughisky employs sophisticated malware families and tools, such as Kuangdao, Specas, Roudan, and LuckDLL, to evade detection and conduct cyberespionage activities. The group's capabilities have been evolving over the last decade, with changes in malware routines indicating potential shifts in objectives and organizational structures. Researchers have noted overlaps in malware and tools used by Earth Aughisky with other cyberespionage groups, suggesting potential connections and collaborations. The group's longevity and adaptability highlight the need for organizations to remain vigilant and prepared for future attacks. The full analysis and recommendations on Earth Aughisky can be found in the research report "The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started."





Report 2

In late August 2015, Symantec identified a threat actor known as "Taidoor" targeting organizations primarily in Taiwan, Brazil, and the United States with a custom-built backdoor Trojan named Dripion. The threat actor used disguised domains as C&C servers, including domains resembling antivirus company websites. The Dripion malware had information-stealing capabilities and was distributed through a downloader called Blugger, which used encryption to evade detection. The threat actor used publicly accessible blogs to distribute the malware, with a focus on targets in Taiwan. The Dripion malware allowed attackers to execute remote commands and steal information from victims. The threat actor behind Dripion had the capability to create and update custom malware, making detection more difficult. Symantec attributed the activity involving Dripion to the Budminer advanced threat group, indicating a link to previous cyberespionage campaigns involving the Taidoor Trojan. The investigation highlighted the importance of multilayered security to detect unknown threats.





Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor Taidoor, also known as Budminer and Earth Aughisky, has been active since at least 2009, with a primary focus on targeting the Taiwanese government through socially engineered emails with malware attachments. The attackers used Taiwanese IP addresses for command and control and displayed a high level of social engineering by spoofing government email addresses. The Taidoor malware allowed for interactive shell operations on compromised computers, indicating a capability for information theft and espionage. The attackers quickly assessed their targets and disabled malware on unintended systems, showing a level of sophistication in their operations. The threat actor has targeted victims in Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the USA, primarily in the government sector. The latest reported hacking operation targeting Taiwan occurred in late 2015 with a new cyberespionage backdoor Trojan. The threat actor's origin is reported to be China.
