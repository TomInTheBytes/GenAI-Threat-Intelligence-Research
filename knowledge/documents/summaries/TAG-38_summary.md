Report 1

Summary:
- Threat actor: Chinese state-sponsored activity group, temporarily named Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38).
- Region: India, specifically targeting Indian power grid assets, including State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) in North India.
- Operating sector: Power sector, national emergency response system, and a multinational logistics company.
- Date: Ongoing targeting detected after a short lull following a February 2021 report.
- Evidence of capability: Continued use of ShadowPad backdoor by Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups.
- Novelty of tools and techniques: Use of ShadowPad, FastReverseProxy (FRP), and compromise of internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control.
- Objective: Likely long-term strategic priority for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors to gather information on critical infrastructure systems or pre-position for future activity.
- Concerns: Prolonged targeting raises concerns over pre-positioning activity by Chinese adversaries despite partial troop disengagement.
- Attribution: Technical evidence does not allow direct attribution to RedEcho, clustering under the temporary name TAG-38.
- Key judgments: Targeting likely for capability development or future contingency operations rather than economic espionage.





Report 2

Summary:
TAG-38, a state-sponsored threat actor from China, has been targeting Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for grid control in North India near the India-China border. They have also compromised a national emergency response system and an Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company. The threat actor used Shadowpad malware infections controlled through internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices and the open source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP). Despite similarities to previous RedEcho activity, technical evidence does not allow direct attribution. The motivation behind the attacks is information theft and espionage. The threat actor's capabilities and novel tools raise concerns about pre-positioning activities in Indian critical infrastructure. The activity has been ongoing since 2021, with the latest observations reported in 2022.
