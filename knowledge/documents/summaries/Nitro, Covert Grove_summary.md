Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Nitro" has been identified as using new indicators of compromise, including malware variants such as "Spindest," "PCClient," and "Farfli." The group has evolved its malware and delivery methods since 2013, moving away from Poison Ivy malware to include Spindest and compromised legitimate websites. The victims targeted by Nitro include companies in the IT solutions, space imagery, power technologies, medical imaging, and dental imaging sectors. The threat actor has been observed using C2 infrastructure and domains that have been in use for some time, making it easier for security teams to block their activities. Nitro's use of new malware variants and historical IP resolution overlap indicates their continued evolution in evading detection. The report provides detailed information on specific malware samples, their timestamps, file names, sizes, and C2 URLs. The findings highlight the importance of tracking APT groups over time to uncover new indicators of compromise. The tools and techniques used by Nitro have been properly identified by WildFire as malware for Palo Alto Networks customers.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor Nitro, also known as Covert Grove, has been active since 2011, with a recent attack campaign targeting the chemical industry lasting two and a half months. A total of 29 companies in the chemical sector and 19 in other sectors, primarily defense, were confirmed as targets. The attackers have shown the capability to adapt their targets over time, with evidence of using tools like Gh0st RAT, PCClient, and Spindest. The attackers have been linked to APT 18, Dynamite Panda, and Wekby. The motivation behind the attacks is information theft and espionage, with the threat actor originating from China. The victims operate in sectors such as automotive, chemical, NGOs, and technology, spanning across multiple countries. Notably, Nitro has modified their malware and delivery methods over time, including the use of Spindest and legitimate compromised websites. The latest indicators of compromise were found in 2014, indicating ongoing activity by the threat actor.





Report 3

The "Nitro" attacks, documented by Symantec, targeted at least 100 computers globally from April to October 2011. The attackers used the Poison Ivy backdoor, allowing real-time access to compromised computers. They targeted a variety of sectors, including chemical companies, human rights NGOs, motor companies, and defense contractors. The attackers maintained segmented command and control infrastructure, making it challenging to uncover the full extent of their operations. The use of dynamic DNS services and distinct sets of C&C infrastructure showcased the sophistication of the attackers. Understanding the tools, tactics, and procedures of such threat actors is crucial for effective defense strategies. The report highlights the importance of threat intelligence and context-aware data protection in mitigating targeted attacks.
