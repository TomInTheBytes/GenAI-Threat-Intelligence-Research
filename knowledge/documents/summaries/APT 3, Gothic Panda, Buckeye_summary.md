Report 1

APT 3, also known as Buckeye, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110, is a cyberespionage group that has been active for over half a decade. Initially targeting organizations in the US, the group shifted its focus to political entities in Hong Kong since June 2015. Buckeye has been observed using a remote access Trojan (Backdoor.Pirpi) and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. The group has targeted approximately 82 organizations in various regions, with a particular interest in Hong Kong, the US, and the UK. Buckeye's tools include a keylogger, RemoteCMD, PwDumpVariant, OSinfo, ChromePass, and Lazagne, indicating a sophisticated and state-sponsored cyberespionage capability. Symantec, Norton, and Blue Coat products offer protection against Buckeye's activities. The report provides evidence of Buckeye's evolving tactics and novel techniques, making it a significant threat actor in the cybersecurity landscape.





Report 2

Summary: APT 3, also known as Gothic Panda or Buckeye, is identified as Boyusec, a Chinese Intelligence Contractor based in Guangdong, China. The threat actor is linked to individuals Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao, who have a history of purchasing APT 3 infrastructure. Boyusec, licensed in December 2013, is associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), indicating involvement in Chinese Intelligence Cyber operations. The evidence suggests that Boyusec is APT 3, highlighting the capability of the threat actor in targeted cyber attacks. The use of novel tools and techniques by APT 3 underscores their advanced cyber capabilities. (Date: May 9, 2017)





Report 3

Summary:
APT 3, also known as Gothic Panda and Buckeye, is a sophisticated threat group sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of State Security and the internet security firm Boyusec. Active since at least 2010, APT 3 targets companies in defense, telecommunications, transportation, and advanced technology sectors, as well as government departments in various countries. The threat actor employs a variety of tools and techniques, including spear-phishing attacks, zero-day exploits, and unique remote access tools. APT 3 has been involved in multiple hacking operations, such as Operation "Clandestine Fox" and "Double Tap," utilizing tools like DoublePulsar and Bemstour. The threat actor has been observed shifting focus from the US to Hong Kong. Counter operations against APT 3 include a 2017 indictment by the DOJ against Chinese cyber spies linked to the group.





Report 4

APT3, also known as Gothic Panda or Buckeye, conducted Operation Clandestine Wolf, a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113) in June 2015. The threat actor, based in China, is sophisticated and has a history of introducing new browser-based zero-day exploits. APT3 targeted organizations in Aerospace and Defense, Construction and Engineering, High Tech, Telecommunications, and Transportation sectors. The phishing emails used in the campaign were generic, appearing almost like spam. The attack exploited an unpatched vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player, using vector corruption techniques to bypass security measures. A custom backdoor known as SHOTPUT was delivered to victims' systems. APT3's capability to quickly dump credentials, move laterally, and install custom backdoors showcases their proficiency. The threat actor's use of novel techniques, such as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and exploit packaging with RC4 encryption, demonstrates their advanced capabilities. The operation time window was in June 2015.





Report 5

APT 3, also known as Gothic Panda or Buckeye, initiated Operation Double Tap targeting multiple organizations on November 19, 2014. The threat actor leveraged known vulnerabilities CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113, demonstrating a shift in strategy by incorporating widely used exploits into their toolkits. A notable aspect of this operation was the use of a spearphishing campaign offering free membership to a website, containing exploit code and a VBScript to download a payload. The payload, install.exe, attempted to write files to the system and establish a SOCKS5 connection to a remote server. APT 3 was observed sending out spearphishing messages with a similar downloader variant connecting to known APT3 domains. The threat actor's ability to operate successfully without relying solely on zero-day exploits indicates a change in strategy towards more frequent attacks. The operation showcased the threat actor's capability to adapt and execute attacks using novel tools and techniques.





Report 6

Summary:
APT3, also known as Gothic Panda and Buckeye, has been attributed with high confidence to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). The threat actor group has been active since at least 2010 and utilizes a variety of tools and techniques, including spearphishing attacks and zero-day exploits. A mysterious group called "intrusiontruth" linked APT3 to Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, a contractor for the MSS. Recorded Future's research corroborated this connection, indicating that Boyusec is working on behalf of the MSS. APT3 has targeted companies in defense, telecommunications, transportation, and advanced technology sectors, as well as government departments in various countries. The threat actor's collaboration with Huawei and Guangdong ITSEC, both linked to the MSS, highlights the novel use of cover companies for intelligence operations. The implications of APT3's activities extend to supporting China's political, economic, diplomatic, and military goals, requiring targeted companies to enhance their security measures against state-sponsored threats. The MSS's operational model involves utilizing seemingly legitimate organizations at all levels to conduct intelligence operations, showcasing a sophisticated and strategic approach to cyber activity.
