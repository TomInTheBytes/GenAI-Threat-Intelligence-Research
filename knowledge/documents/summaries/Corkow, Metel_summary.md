Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Metel" or "Corkow" is a banking Trojan that was discovered in 2011 and has since targeted banks and financial institutions, particularly in Russia. The threat actor is capable of automating ATM balance rollbacks, allowing for multiple transactions at different ATM machines while keeping the card balance unchanged. The victims of these attacks are limited to banks and financial institutions, with specific targets including online banking databases, accounting department computers with access to money transactions, and servers of Payment APIs. The threat actor's tools and techniques are considered novel, as they involve lateral movement within organizations using legitimate and pentesting tools. Kaspersky Lab researchers have identified attacks only in Russia so far, but suspect the infection may be more widespread globally. Organizations are advised to proactively check for infection and use advanced anti-malware solutions to protect against this threat.
