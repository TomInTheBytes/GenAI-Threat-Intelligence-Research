Report 1

Earth Longzhi, a subgroup of APT41, has reemerged targeting organizations in Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Fiji. The threat actor used new techniques in its infection routine, including DLL sideloading and exploiting a vulnerable driver to disable security products. Earth Longzhi employed a new denial-of-service technique called "stack rumbling" via Image File Execution Options (IFEO). The threat actor also installed drivers as kernel-level services using Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to evade detection. The campaign targeted public-facing applications, IIS servers, and Microsoft Exchange servers to install Behinder, a powerful web shell variant. Earth Longzhi introduced new variants of Croxloader and a tool named "SPHijacker" to disable security products. The threat actor also used open-source projects to implement tools like dwm.exe for privilege escalation. The campaign targeted government, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing sectors in the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, and Fiji. The threat actor showed an inclination towards targeting Vietnam and Indonesia in future campaigns. The report provides detailed technical analysis and indicators of compromise for threat hunting and mitigation efforts.





Report 2

Earth Longzhi, a subgroup of APT41, has been active since 2020 and was first seen targeting a company in Taiwan in early 2022 using a custom Cobalt Strike loader. The threat actor has since expanded its operations to multiple regions, including China, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine, targeting sectors such as Aviation, Defense, Education, Financial, Government, and Healthcare. Earth Longzhi's motivation is information theft and espionage. The threat actor has been observed using tools like BigpipeLoader, CroxLoader, and Symatic Loader. A report from 2023 details an attack on Security Titans by Earth Longzhi, showcasing their novel techniques and capabilities.





Report 3

Earth Longzhi, a subgroup of APT41, has been active since 2020 and has targeted victims in Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ukraine. They use spear-phishing emails to deliver malware, including custom Cobalt Strike loaders like Symatic and CroxLoader. Earth Longzhi has developed new loaders like BigpipeLoader and OutLoader in their second campaign from August 2021 to June 2022. They also use custom hacking tools like ProcBurner and AVBurner to disable security products. The group shares Cobalt Strike metadata with other APT41 subgroups, indicating a connection. Earth Longzhi's activities show a focus on offensive security techniques and a familiarity with red-team operations. The group's use of publicly available tools and shared TTPs make detection and attribution challenging. The report provides detailed technical analysis and IOCs for further investigation.
