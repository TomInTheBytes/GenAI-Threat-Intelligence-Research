Report 1

Sea Turtle is a threat actor that has been targeting victims in Turkey, particularly those focused on domestic Turkish issues. The threat actor has been using traditional malware for access, as well as complex DNS hijacking techniques. Sea Turtle leverages a variety of techniques such as passive or active DNS pivoting, SSL certificate tracking, and matching server response content to find similar infrastructure. They frequently point their domains at large cloud providers to provide a veil of legitimacy. Sea Turtle has been known to spoof news-related websites and has been observed using the '426' error response code on suspicious servers. The threat actor also acquires domains that look legitimate to improve their risk score. Sea Turtle's capability is evidenced by their use of novel tools and techniques, as well as their ability to pivot through a sea of indicators. The operation time window for this threat actor is ongoing, with the latest report published on December 27, 2023.





Report 2

Sea Turtle, also known as Silicon, UNC1326, Marbled Dust, Teal Kurma, and Cosmic Wolf, is a threat actor first seen in 2017 and still active as of the first quarter of 2019. Operating primarily in the Middle East and North Africa, Sea Turtle targets public and private entities, including national security organizations, with a focus on DNS hijacking to redirect user traffic. The threat actor, believed to be state-sponsored, has compromised at least 40 organizations across 13 countries, including sectors such as Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government, NGOs, Telecommunications, and Intelligence agencies. Sea Turtle's motivation is information theft and espionage, with reported hacking operations using tools like Drupalgeddon and DNS hijacking. Notably, in 2019, the Institute of Computer Science of Greece confirmed a network compromise by Sea Turtle. The threat actor's novel techniques and persistent access capabilities pose a significant cybersecurity risk.





Report 3

Sea Turtle, also known as Teal Kurma, is a highly capable threat actor operating in the TÃ¼rkiye-nexus region, primarily targeting Europe and the Middle East. The threat actor targets private and public sector organizations, including NGOs, IT, and telecommunication sectors. Between 2021 and 2023, Sea Turtle used a Linux/Unix malware named "SnappyTCP" for establishing persistence on systems, with variants using plaintext and TLS communication. The threat actor likely controlled a GitHub account with code similar to the malware. Infrastructure associated with Sea Turtle included domains spoofing NGOs and Media organizations, indicating espionage motives for surveillance and intelligence gathering. The threat actor targets governments, telecommunication, IT service providers, NGOs, and Media sectors in the Middle East and Europe. The malware samples showed variations in toolchains and architectures, suggesting multiple developers or cross-compilation. The threat actor's focus on specific sectors and regions provides insights for attribution and detection. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for organizations to investigate and block malicious indicators.





Report 4

Sea Turtle, a threat actor believed to be aligned with Turkish interests, has been observed conducting cyberattacks in the Netherlands targeting organizations in the telecommunication, media, ISPs, and IT-service provider sectors, with a focus on Kurdish websites. The group, also known as Teal Kurma, Marbled Dust, SILICON, and Cosmic Wolf, primarily aims to acquire economic and political intelligence through espionage and information theft. Sea Turtle's modus operandi involves DNS hijacking, intercepting internet traffic, and using a reverse shell mechanism for data collection and exfiltration. The threat actor has been observed using a reverse TCP shell named SnappyTCP for Linux/Unix with basic command-and-control capabilities during campaigns in 2021 and 2023. Sea Turtle has been seen compromising cPanel accounts, using SSH for initial access, and executing defense evasion techniques to avoid detection. The threat actor has also been observed collecting email archives and utilizing a command-and-control channel to communicate with compromised systems. Sea Turtle's activities align with strategic Turkish interests and demonstrate moderate sophistication in their operations. The threat actor's use of novel tools and techniques, such as publicly available code from GitHub repositories, highlights their evolving capabilities. The campaigns conducted by Sea Turtle in the Netherlands showcase their persistence and focus on acquiring sensitive data for intelligence gathering purposes. The threat actor's activities underscore the importance of organizations implementing cybersecurity measures to mitigate the risks posed by such advanced persistent threats. (Date: 2021-2023)
