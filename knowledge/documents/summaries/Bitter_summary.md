Report 5

Summary:
The Bitter APT group, also known as T-APT-17, has been identified by Cyble Research Labs as using the "Dracarys" Android Spyware in a recent campaign. The group, active since 2013, operates in South Asia and targets countries such as China, India, and Pakistan. Bitter APT is known for its desktop and mobile malware campaigns, utilizing techniques like spear phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities to deliver Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other malware.
