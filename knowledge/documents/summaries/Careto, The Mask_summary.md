Report 2

The Careto/Mask APT, also known as "The Mask," is an advanced threat actor involved in cyber-espionage operations since at least 2007. The threat actor targets government institutions, diplomatic offices, energy companies, research institutions, private equity firms, and activists across 31 countries. The complexity of the toolset used by the attackers, including sophisticated malware, rootkit, bootkit, and versions for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and possibly Android and iOS, sets The Mask apart. The threat actor exploits zero-day vulnerabilities, such as the Adobe Flash Player exploit CVE-2012-0773, and uses spear-phishing emails with malicious links to infect target machines. The attackers have been active for several years, with evidence of advanced technologies and state-sponsored operations. Kaspersky Lab detects multiple variants of the malware and provides Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to help victims identify the intrusion. The report was published on February 10, 2014, by Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT).
