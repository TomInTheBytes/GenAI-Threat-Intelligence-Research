Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as DarkPulsar, linked to the Shadow Brokers, was active in March 2017 and targeted victims in Russia, Iran, and Egypt. The victims were primarily in the sectors of nuclear energy, telecommunications, IT, aerospace, and R&D, with a focus on Windows 2003/2008 Server systems. DarkPulsar utilized advanced capabilities to control infected machines through a backdoor named 'sipauth32.tsp'. The threat actor used unique tools and techniques, such as embedding malware traffic into system protocols and bypassing authentication processes to gain access to protected objects. The DarkPulsar implant was a dynamic library with malicious payloads implemented in exported functions, allowing for stealthy and persistent compromise. The threat actor's tools, including FuzzBunch and DanderSpritz, were designed for flexibility and compatibility with other tools, showcasing a high level of professionalism in their attack methods. The DarkPulsar backdoor served as a bridge between the two leaked frameworks, enabling long-term compromise and advanced control over infected systems. The threat actor's activities were detected through network traffic analysis and the identification of specific indicators of compromise (IOCs).

The Shadow Brokers warned of more files to come, with researchers calling it the most damaging leak to date. The leaked information showcases the capability of the threat actor to target financial and oil sectors in the Middle East using novel tools and techniques. Date: 14th April 2017.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as ShadowBrokers released additional hacking tools allegedly belonging to the Equation Group on April 10, 2017. The dump focused on UNIX systems and GSM networks, targeting big corporations or telecoms companies. The tools included remote code execution attacks, antiforensics tools, backdoors, post-exploitation remote access shells, keyloggers, network monitoring tools, and kernel-level implants for UNIX systems. The Equation Group was particularly invested in exploiting and attacking GSM core networks, with access to the Pakistan Mobilink GSM network. The dump included over 1,000 files, and it is unknown if any vulnerabilities exploited remain unpatched. The identity of the ShadowBrokers remains unknown, with speculation ranging from an intelligence outfit to an NSA insider. The tools released were considered older exploits, but their specificity and targeting of high-profile systems indicate the threat actor's capability and persistence.





Report 5

ShadowBrokers, a notorious hacking group, has returned demanding nearly $4 million and offering two data dumps per month. The group announced changes to their Dump Service, including the requirement to pay with ZCash cryptocurrency. The hackers have leaked exploits allegedly stolen from the NSA-linked group Equation Group, such as the UNITEDRAKE implant used by the NSA's elite hacking unit TAO. The group is offering the exploits for 16,000 ZEC, equivalent to $3,914,080. The leaked manual for UNITEDRAKE describes it as a fully extensible remote collection system designed for Windows targets. The ShadowBrokers have made previous dumps available and are actively exploiting vulnerabilities.





Report 6

The threat actor known as Shadow Brokers, first seen in 2016, breached a server holding zero-days accumulated by Equation Group, leaking a large section on the internet and attempting to sell the rest for financial gain. The leaked vulnerabilities, including ETERNALBLUE, were used in infamous ransomware attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya. The threat actor was revealed to be an ex-NSA contractor from the USA. Shadow Brokers released multiple dumps of stolen data, including frameworks like DanderSpritz and FuzzBunch, and demanded payment for further releases. Counter operations were launched against the threat actor, with arrests made in connection to the leaks. The threat actor's activities have impacted various sectors and countries, with their tools and techniques demonstrating a high level of sophistication and novelty.





Report 7

Summary:
The Shadow Brokers leaked NSA documents and tools that revealed successful hacking operations targeting Russian and Iranian entities, including the Office of the President of Iran and the Russian Federal Nuclear Center. The leaked files provided evidence of the NSA's ability to intrude into high-profile foreign targets. The tools used, such as "stoicsurgeon" and "suctionchar," were novel and sophisticated, with specific references to targeted host machines and operations. The leaked information shed light on the NSA's cyber espionage capabilities and operations, showcasing a level of technical expertise and operational success. The leaked documents were published on April 8, 2017, and offered authentic internal information regarding past agency operations. The targets included websites of government entities and internet service providers in Iran, Russia, and other regions. The tools used by the threat actor demonstrated advanced capabilities in compromising systems and networks.





Report 8

The threat actor known as "Shadow Brokers" is a mysterious hacking group responsible for stealing a large cache of National Security Agency (NSA) hacking tools. They expressed frustration at the lack of interest in bidding on their stolen malware tools in a post on Medium in October 1, 2016. The group, known for their Borat-style broken English communication, criticized individuals and organizations for not bidding on their files. The stolen files contained exploit code matching NSA hacking tools, leading experts to believe they were left behind on a compromised server by an NSA-linked hacking entity called Equation Group. The group has only received bids totaling 1.76 bitcoins, far below their asking price of $1 million. The novelty of their tools and techniques lies in the stolen NSA hacking tools and the ransom-style approach to releasing them. The victims targeted were not specified in the report.
