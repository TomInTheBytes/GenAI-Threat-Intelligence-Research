Report 1

Neodymium is an activity group that has been active since 2016, with a focus on targeting Turkish victims in the information theft and espionage sectors. The group has been linked to other activity groups such as Promethium and StrongPity, showing similarities in victim targeting and campaign characteristics. Neodymium is known to use a backdoor malware called Wingbird, which resembles the FinFisher surveillance package. The group primarily targets individual computers rather than networks. The threat actor has been associated with BlackOasis operations, but it is unclear if these are aliases. Neodymium's operations have been observed in Europe, with the latest reported activity in May 2016. The group's use of Wingbird indicates a high level of sophistication and capability in conducting targeted cyber attacks.





Report 2

Neodymium, along with the activity group PROMETHIUM, conducted twin zero-day attacks targeting individuals in Europe in early May 2016. Unlike typical threat actors, Neodymium and PROMETHIUM targeted individuals for information gathering rather than monetary gain or economic espionage. Neodymium used a backdoor malware called Wingbird, which closely resembles FinFisher, a government-grade surveillance package. The group exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117) to launch attacks through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. Neodymium's use of the same exploit as PROMETHIUM, along with the timing and geographic location of the attacks, suggests a connection between the two groups. Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) can detect and respond to Neodymium's activities, including zero-day exploits and malicious file injections. The report provides indicators of compromise for Neodymium and PROMETHIUM, along with details on how Windows Defender ATP can help organizations defend against advanced attacks.
