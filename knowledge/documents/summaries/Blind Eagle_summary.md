Report 2

Summary:
APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle, has updated its long-term spam campaign targeting South American entities with commodity RATs. The threat actor sends phishing emails using RATs such as njRAT, Imminent Monitor, and BitRAT, among others. The emails impersonate entities like Colombiaâ€™s national directorate of taxes and customs to lure victims. APT-C-36 uses URL shorteners for geographical targeting and employs new tactics like geolocation filtering to avoid detection. The threat actor targets industries like government, finance, healthcare, finance, telecommunications, and energy. The campaign primarily affects Colombia but also targets other South American countries. APT-C-36's goal appears to be financial gain rather than espionage. The threat actor constantly modifies their methods and payloads to evade detection. The report provides security recommendations and indicators of compromise for protection against such threats. The report was published by Trend Micro on an unspecified date.





Report 3

Blind Eagle, also known as APT-C-36, is a threat actor group originating from Colombia that has been active since April 2018. They have targeted Colombian government institutions and major corporations in sectors such as finance, petroleum, and manufacturing. The group has been observed using a variety of RATs (Remote Access Trojans) such as AsyncRAT, BitRAT, and LimeRAT to carry out their attacks. They have also targeted victims in countries like Ecuador, Panama, and Spain. Blind Eagle's motivation appears to be information theft and espionage. The group has been linked to multiple hacking operations, with the most recent one in February 2023 targeting Colombia's judiciary, financial, public, and law enforcement entities using fake UUE files and Fsociety. Counter operations against Blind Eagle have been reported, indicating efforts to mitigate their activities.





Report 4

Blind Eagle, also known as APT-C-36, has been targeting organizations in Colombia and Ecuador since at least 2019, focusing on spear-phishing emails to conduct campaigns. The threat actor impersonated a Colombian government tax agency to target key industries in Colombia, including health, financial, law enforcement, immigration, and peace negotiation agencies. Evidence suggests campaigns targeting Ecuador, Chile, and Spain as well. The threat actor uses sophisticated techniques like spear-phishing attachments with PDFs, fake websites, and PowerShell commands to deploy payloads. Novel tools like Fsociety and AsyncRAT are used to establish remote access and exfiltrate information. The threat actor uses Dynamic DNS services like DuckDNS for communication with infected machines. Targets include health, public, financial, judiciary, and law enforcement entities in Colombia. The group's tactics, techniques, and procedures align with previous campaigns, indicating a moderate level of confidence in attribution to APT-C-36. The campaign aims at information theft and espionage, with a focus on Hispanic geographic regions. The threat actor is likely to continue evolving its tactics to deceive victims in the future. The report includes Yara rules for detection and offers a private version with additional threat detection content upon request.
