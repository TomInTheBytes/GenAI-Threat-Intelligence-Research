Report 2

The "Silent Skimmer" campaign, discovered by BlackBerry, involves a financially motivated threat actor targeting online payment businesses in the APAC and NALA regions. The attacker compromises web servers using vulnerabilities to deploy payment scraping mechanisms on compromised websites, extracting sensitive financial data. The threat actor is proficient in the Chinese language and operates predominantly in the Asia-Pacific region. The campaign has been active for over a year, targeting industries hosting payment infrastructure like online businesses and Point of Sales (POS) providers. The threat actor uses a variety of tools and techniques, including Privilege Escalations, Remote Code Execution, and Post Exploitation tools. Novel tools like Godzilla Webshells and PowerShell RATs are used, with the campaign focusing on exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to extract payment data. The threat actor adjusts network infrastructure based on victim geolocation, making it difficult to trace traffic. The campaign targets vulnerable web applications globally, with an increase in targeting North America since October 2022. The threat actor remains unidentified, but evidence suggests Chinese-speaking developers are involved. The Silent Skimmer campaign showcases the ease with which attackers can compromise IIS servers connected to the Internet, posing a threat to sensitive data security. The threat actor's technical complexity and expansion to new regions indicate an advanced and evolving operation.
