Report 1

BRONZE STARLIGHT is a threat actor group operating in the region of China, targeting victims primarily in the Japanese organizations' intellectual property sector. They have been active since at least 2015, using HUI Loader to deploy remote access trojans (RATs) and ransomware like LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by their use of advanced techniques such as disabling Windows Event Tracing, hooking Windows API calls, and deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon. The novelty of their tools includes an updated version of HUI Loader using the RC4 cipher for decryption. The victims targeted by BRONZE STARLIGHT are diverse, including pharmaceutical companies, media organizations, electronic component designers, law firms, and aerospace and defense divisions. The threat actor's main motivation appears to be intellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial gain, as indicated by their victimology and tactics. The threat actor's connections to Chinese government-sponsored threat groups like BRONZE RIVERSIDE and BRONZE UNIVERSITY suggest a high level of sophistication and access to advanced malware. The threat actor's use of ransomware is likely a tactic to distract investigators, destroy evidence, and exfiltrate sensitive data, rather than for financial gain. The threat actor's operational cadence and victimology do not align with conventional financially motivated cybercrime operations, indicating a more strategic and targeted approach. The use of ransomware by BRONZE STARLIGHT is likely aimed at achieving tactical objectives such as destroying evidence, distracting investigators, and exfiltrating data to mask their true operational objectives. The threat indicators associated with BRONZE STARLIGHT can be used to detect their activity and prevent further intrusions.





Report 2

Bronze Starlight, also known as DEV-0401 and Cinnamon Tempest, is a threat actor group that has been active since mid-2021, targeting organizations globally across various industry verticals. They utilize HUI Loader to load Cobalt Strike and PlugX payloads for command and control, with a focus on deploying ransomware for name-and-shame schemes. The group is assessed to be located in China based on observed tradecraft and tools associated with China-based threat groups. Their motivation appears to be information theft and espionage, rather than financial gain through ransomware. Victims targeted by Bronze Starlight include companies in the casinos and gambling sector, particularly in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. The threat actor's operations include the use of tools such as AtomSilo, LockFile, and Rook, with a reported hacking operation in 2023 involving DLL hijacking in the Asian gambling sector. The group's activities demonstrate a high level of sophistication and a novel approach to cyber threats.
