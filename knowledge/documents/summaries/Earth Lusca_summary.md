Report 1

Earth Lusca, a threat actor originating from China, has been active since 2019 and has been attributed to various malware such as ShadowPad and Winnti. The group's activities have targeted customer service companies in China, as well as various sectors including casinos, education, government, media, and telecommunications in countries like Australia, Germany, and the USA. Earth Lusca's TTPs and infrastructure set it apart from other threat actors, leading to its identification as a separate entity. The threat actor has been observed using a variety of tools such as Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and WinRAR, with a recent operation in 2023 involving a new Linux backdoor and the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement. The motivation behind Earth Lusca's activities includes information theft, espionage, and financial gain. The threat actor's novel techniques and tools highlight its advanced capabilities in conducting cyber operations.





Report 2

Earth Lusca, a threat actor operating since early 2021, has extended its operations targeting government departments in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Balkans during the first half of 2023. The threat actor employs a new Linux backdoor named SprySOCKS, derived from the open-source Windows backdoor Trochilus, for espionage activities. SprySOCKS uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and targets public-facing servers by exploiting known vulnerabilities, including those in Fortinet, GitLab, and Microsoft Exchange. The threat actor's C&C server domains include lt76ux[.]confenos[.]shop and 2e6veme8xs[.]bmssystemg188[.]us. The SprySOCKS backdoor shows similarities to RedLeaves and Derusbi malware, indicating a novel approach by Earth Lusca. The threat actor's aggressive targeting of vulnerable servers underscores the importance of proactive security measures and patch management. Trend Micro XDR is recommended for comprehensive security against Earth Lusca and similar threat actors.
