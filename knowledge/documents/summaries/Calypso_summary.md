Report 1

Summary:
Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, including RedFoxtrot and Calypso APT, targeted the mail server of Afghan telecommunications firm Roshan from at least July 2020 to September 2021. The activity spiked in August and September 2021, coinciding with major geopolitical events in Afghanistan. The Chinese Communist Party's interest in expanding influence in Afghanistan under Taliban rule drove the intelligence gathering efforts. The threat actor's capability was evidenced by the use of Winnti and PlugX backdoors, with data exfiltration activities observed. The novel techniques included the use of Winnti backdoor, historically linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups. The targeting of Roshan by multiple Chinese groups indicates a lack of coordination among the threat actors. The telecommunications sector in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative is considered strategically significant by the Chinese government. The threat landscape in Central Asia, including Afghanistan, remains active and poses a high risk to telecommunications organizations.





Report 2

Calypso, also known as Bronze Medley, is a threat actor first seen in 2016 and primarily targets governmental institutions in Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey. The group's main goal is information theft and espionage, with evidence suggesting they are of Asian origin, specifically from China. They have been observed using a variety of tools such as Calypso RAT, Mimikatz, and EternalBlue, among others.
