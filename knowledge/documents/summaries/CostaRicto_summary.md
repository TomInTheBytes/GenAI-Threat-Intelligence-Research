Report 2

The CostaRicto campaign, operated by a group of APT mercenaries, targets victims globally, with a concentration in South Asia, especially India, Bangladesh, and Singapore. The threat actor possesses bespoke malware tooling and complex VPN proxy and SSH tunnelling capabilities. The campaign utilizes a new strain of malware called Sombra, with a well-structured code and detailed versioning system, suggesting a long-term project. The threat actor uses a variety of tools and techniques, including custom backdoors, VM-based payload loaders, and reflective PE injection modules. The threat actor's victims are diverse across various sectors, with a focus on financial institutions. The campaign employs DNS tunneling and SSL-encrypted C2 communication to evade detection. The threat actor's infrastructure overlaps with a previous phishing campaign attributed to APT28, but researchers believe there is no direct link between the two. The threat actor behind CostaRicto is likely a mercenary group, outsourcing attacks to protect their identity and expand their capabilities. The campaign demonstrates a high level of sophistication and operational security, making attribution challenging.
