Report 1

APT33, also known as Elfin or Magnallium, is a threat actor with ties to the Iranian government, engaging in cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. The threat actor targets organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors, particularly in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. APT33 uses spear phishing emails with recruitment-themed lures and malicious attachments to deliver custom backdoors like TURNEDUP. The threat actor has also registered domains masquerading as aviation companies to target victims. APT33 has been linked to an Iranian persona associated with the "Nasr Institute," suggesting government sponsorship. The threat actor has potential ties to destructive capabilities, as seen with the DROPSHOT dropper linked to the SHAPESHIFT wiper malware. APT33's operational hours align with Iran's workweek, and they use Iranian hacker tools and name servers, indicating a likely base in Iran. The threat actor's strategic espionage targeting suggests a focus on gaining insights for military and strategic decision-making, with a potential for destructive operations. The use of multiple custom backdoors and ties to SHAPESHIFT differentiate APT33 from other Iran-based threat groups like SHAMOON. Overall, APT33's activities indicate a government-sponsored threat actor with advanced capabilities and a focus on strategic intelligence gathering. (Source: FireEye)

Report 4

APT 33, also known as Elfin Team, Magnallium, and other aliases, is an Iranian hacker group identified by FireEye as being supported by the government of Iran. The group was formed no later than 2013 and has targeted aerospace, defense, and petrochemical industry targets in the United States, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. APT 33 uses tools like DropShot, ShapeShift, TurnedUp, and ALFASHELL for their operations. They have registered domains impersonating commercial entities like Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Evidence suggests ties between APT 33 and the Iranian Nasr Institute, with one hacker known as xman_1365_x linked to both the TurnedUp tool code and the Iranian Cyber Army. The group's activities have been most active during Iran Standard Time business hours. The report was last edited on January 23, 2024.





Report 5

Summary:
APT33, also known as Peach Sandstorm, HOLMIUM, or Refined Kitten, an Iranian cyber-espionage group, targeted defense contractors worldwide with a new FalseFont backdoor malware. The group has been active since at least 2013 and targets a wide range of industry sectors in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. FalseFont provides remote access to compromised systems, file execution, and file transfer to command-and-control servers. The malware was first observed in early November 2023, indicating ongoing improvement in the group's tradecraft. Microsoft advises network defenders to reset credentials and secure accounts with multi-factor authentication. APT33 previously conducted password spray attacks targeting organizations in the defense sector, resulting in data theft. Other state-sponsored threat actors from Russia, North Korea, and China have also targeted defense agencies and contractors. The report was published on December 21, 2023.





Report 6

Summary:
APT33, also known as Elfin or Magnallium, is a threat actor targeting the oil and aviation industries aggressively. They have been using obfuscated Command and Control (C&C) servers for extremely narrow targeting against organizations in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia. The threat actor uses small botnets with basic malware capabilities to gain persistence within select targets' networks. APT33 has been executing aggressive attacks, including spear phishing campaigns against companies in the oil supply chain. They have been observed using private VPN networks for reconnaissance and administering C&C servers, making tracking more difficult. The threat actor has a clear interest in websites related to the recruitment of employees in the oil and gas industry. APT33 poses a serious threat, and organizations in the targeted sectors are advised to establish regular patching policies, improve employee awareness, apply the principle of least privilege, and install multilayered protection systems. The threat actor's tactics and techniques show a high level of sophistication and novel use of private VPN networks for malicious activities. The report was last updated on November 27, 2019, and provides detailed indicators of compromise for detection and mitigation.





Report 7

Since February 2023, Microsoft has observed password spray activity against thousands of organizations by the threat actor Peach Sandstorm (HOLMIUM), an Iranian nation-state actor targeting sectors such as satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical globally. The threat actor used a combination of publicly available and custom tools for discovery, persistence, and lateral movement, exfiltrating data in some cases. Peach Sandstorm's 2023 post-compromise activity showed sophistication and stealthiness, using tools like AzureHound, Roadtools, AnyDesk, and EagleRelay. The threat actor also conducted a Golden SAML attack and DLL search order hijack in some intrusions. Microsoft recommends organizations reset passwords, revoke session cookies, implement MFA, and secure critical assets like AD FS servers to mitigate Peach Sandstorm activity. The threat actor's evolving capabilities require organizations to develop corresponding defenses to raise costs for these attacks. Microsoft continues to monitor Peach Sandstorm activity and implement protections for customers.





Report 8

Summary: US Cyber Command issued an alert about hackers exploiting an Outlook vulnerability, linking the malware to the Iranian hacking group APT33. The threat actor, known as APT33, Elfin, or Magnallium, is a state-developed malware group. The victims targeted were related to government sectors, as evidenced by the NASA hack due to an unauthorized Raspberry Pi connection. The threat actor's capability is demonstrated by their use of novel tools and techniques, as highlighted by FireEye and Palo Alto Network. The operation time window for this alert was around July 3.
