Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as "CloudyOmega" has been actively targeting Japanese organizations since at least 2011, with a focus on the public sector. The attack campaign utilizes a zero-day vulnerability in the Ichitaro software to deliver payloads such as Backdoor.Emdivi, Backdoor.Korplug, and Backdoor.ZXshell, aiming to steal confidential information. The group behind CloudyOmega has connections to other notorious attack groups like Hidden Lynx and LadyBoyle. The malware used, particularly Backdoor.Emdivi, employs advanced techniques to evade detection, such as encryption and anti-analysis measures. The attackers use compromised Japanese websites as command-and-control servers, indicating a high level of sophistication. Symantec recommends applying patches and offers protection against CloudyOmega attacks. The group's persistence and use of novel tools and techniques suggest that their activities will continue.
