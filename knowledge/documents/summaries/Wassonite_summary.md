Report 2

The WASSONITE threat group, identified by Dragos since 2018, targeted multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities in the electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and space-centric research sectors, with a focus on Asian entities, particularly in India. The group's activities represent Stage 1 ICS kill-chain operations within IT networks and do not currently exhibit disruptive or destructive capabilities. WASSONITE utilizes tools such as DTrack malware for remote access, credential theft via Mimikatz, and system tools for lateral movement within enterprise systems. DTrack was first disclosed in late September 2019 and is associated with the Lazarus Group, although WASSONITE's capabilities and infrastructure differ from other Lazarus-linked groups like COVELLITE. Dragos provides comprehensive threat intelligence on industrial control security threats, focusing on behaviors and appropriate detection and response without political attribution. Detailed information on WASSONITE and other threat group activities is available to network defenders through Dragos WorldView.
