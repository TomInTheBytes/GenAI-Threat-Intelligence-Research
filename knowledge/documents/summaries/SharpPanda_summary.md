Summary: The threat actor SharpPanda, believed to be a Chinese APT group, has been conducting an ongoing surveillance operation targeting a Southeast Asian government since 2018. They use spear-phishing and old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities to install a previously unknown backdoor on victim's machines. The group has been refining their tools for at least 3 years, with a motivation for information theft and espionage. The victims operate in the government sector in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian nations. The threat actor's use of the 8.t Dropper tool indicates a level of sophistication in their operations. The report was last modified on April 25, 2023.
