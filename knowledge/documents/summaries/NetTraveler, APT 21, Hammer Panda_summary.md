Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as NetTraveler, APT 21, or Hammer Panda has been identified by Kaspersky Lab as conducting a global cyberespionage campaign targeting government-affiliated organizations and research institutes. Operating since 2004, with peak activity between 2010-2013, the threat actor has infected over 350 high-profile victims in 40 countries, including government institutions, embassies, oil and gas industry, research centers, military contractors, and activists. The NetTraveler group utilized spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333 vulnerabilities. Data theft and exfiltration involved stealing over 22 gigabytes of data, including file system listings, keylogs, and various file types. The threat actor's targets included sectors such as space exploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power, medicine, and communications. The NetTraveler toolkit was capable of installing additional info-stealing malware as a backdoor and customizing attacks to steal sensitive information. The threat actor's victims spanned across countries like the United States, Russia, China, India, and others, with notable victims infected by both NetTraveler and Red October cyberespionage operations. The threat actor's use of novel techniques and tools, along with the customization of attacks, showcases their advanced capabilities in conducting cyberespionage activities. (Date: 2013)

- Date: Throughout 2016
- Infrastructure: C&C and payload hosting domains mimic major news sites or military forums, registered with Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd.
- Conclusion: Chinese actors targeting a variety of interests in Russia and neighboring countries, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance and technological protections against advanced persistent threats.





Report 4

NetTraveler, also known as APT 21 or Hammer Panda, has been active for over a decade, with the earliest indicators of malicious activity dating back to 2004. Operating globally, this threat actor has targeted more than 350 high-profile victims in 40 countries, with recent attacks focusing on Uyghur and Tibetan supporters. The NetTraveler group has been observed using an updated version of their backdoor with a new encryption scheme, targeting industries such as diplomatic, government, private, military, and infrastructure. Their infection method typically involves spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The threat actor exfiltrates various file types after successful infiltration. Kaspersky Lab identified seven command-and-control servers in Hong Kong and one in the USA, recommending blocking these hosts in firewalls. The sophistication and longevity of NetTraveler's operations highlight the need for ongoing vigilance and security measures to mitigate their threats.
