Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor MalKamak, also known as Operation GhostShell, conducted a highly-targeted cyber espionage campaign primarily targeting the Aerospace and Telecommunications industries in the Middle East, with additional victims in the U.S., Russia, and Europe. The campaign aimed to steal sensitive information about critical assets and organizations' infrastructure using a stealthy RAT called ShellClient, which has been under development since at least 2018. MalKamak, identified as a new Iranian threat actor, has distinct features that separate it from other Iranian state-sponsored APT groups. The motivation behind the attacks is information theft and espionage. The observed tools used by MalKamak include PAExec, SafetyKatz, ShellClient, and WinRAR. The threat actor's operations have been ongoing since at least 2018, with evidence of continuous development and evasion of antivirus tools. The report was last modified on November 2, 2021.





Report 2

Summary:
In July 2021, the Cybereason Nocturnus team responded to Operation GhostShell, a cyber espionage campaign targeting Aerospace and Telecommunications industries in the Middle East, U.S., Russia, and Europe. The threat actor, identified as MalKamak, developed a stealthy RAT named ShellClient since 2018, evading detection and remaining unknown. The RAT used cloud-based storage services like Dropbox for Command and Control (C2) communications, making it hard to detect. MalKamak has distinct features from other Iranian threat actors like Chafer APT and Agrius APT. The ShellClient RAT evolved from a simple reverse shell to a sophisticated espionage tool, with ongoing development and new functionalities added. The threat actor's motivation is cyber espionage against select targets in Aerospace and Telecommunications sectors. MalKamak is believed to be a nation-state sponsored APT group operating since at least 2018. The report highlights the novelty of the tools and techniques used by MalKamak, including the use of cloud-based C2 communications and the evolution of the ShellClient RAT.
