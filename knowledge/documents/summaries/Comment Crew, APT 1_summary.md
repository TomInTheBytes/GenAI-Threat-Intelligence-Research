Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Comment Crew, APT 1, is an advanced persistent threat group with links to the Chinese military, active from 2006 to 2010. They targeted over 140 US companies for sensitive corporate and intellectual property data using spear-phishing campaigns. The group used HTML comments to hide communication to command-and-control servers and had various aliases. They are believed to be sponsored by the 2nd Bureau of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army and motivated by information theft and espionage. The group has targeted sectors such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, and more in countries like the USA, UK, and Japan. They have used a variety of tools and techniques, including Mimikatz, Poison Ivy, and Pass-The-Hash Toolkit. Notably, they were involved in operations like "Seasalt" in 2006/2010 and "Oceansalt" in 2018. The group has faced counter operations, with 5 Chinese army members charged in 2014 for cyberattacks.





Report 3

Summary:
Between 2011 and 2012, Chinese hackers targeted three Israeli defense contractors responsible for building the "Iron Dome" missile shield. The attackers exfiltrated large amounts of sensitive data related to missile technology, UAVs, and other defense systems. The threat actor, known as the "Comment Crew," used sophisticated tools and techniques to compromise the networks, including phishing attacks and trojan horse programs. The stolen data included intellectual property restricted by ITAR regulations. The attacks highlight the challenges faced by defense contractors in deterring cyber adversaries. The incident underscores the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored hacking groups and the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures in the defense sector. The report does not specify the operation time window.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as PLA Unit 61398, also referred to as APT1 or Comment Crew, is a Chinese advanced persistent threat unit operating under the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force. Evidence suggests that this threat actor has been conducting cyber espionage attacks since at least 2006, targeting a wide range of corporations and government entities globally. The group is known for using novel techniques, such as compromising internal software features on legitimate websites to infiltrate target computers. In 2014, five officers of PLA Unit 61398 were indicted by the US Department of Justice for theft of confidential business information and intellectual property. The threat actor has targeted organizations in various sectors, including defense, research, shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software. The group has been linked to extensive cyber espionage campaigns, such as Operation Shady RAT, targeting over 70 organizations. The threat actor's activities have been ongoing since at least 2002, with evidence of attacks on more than 1,000 organizations. The group's operations are believed to be conducted during Beijing's business hours, indicating a level of professionalism and organization. In 2020, reports indicated that PLA Unit 61398 was targeting information related to defense and research in India. The Chinese government has denied involvement in hacking activities, despite allegations against PLA Unit 61398.





Report 5

The threat actor known as "Comment Crew, APT 1" targeted RSA, a corporate security giant, in 2011, stealing secret keys known as "seeds" that compromised the security of millions of users in government, military agencies, defense contractors, banks, and corporations worldwide. The threat actor demonstrated high capabilities by methodically siphoning the seeds from RSA's servers and using novel techniques like stealing credentials to access servers hosted by Rackspace. The breach, attributed to Chinese state-sponsored hackers, was a wake-up call for the cybersecurity industry and the world, showcasing the vulnerability of supply chain attacks. The threat actor's ability to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Poison Ivy malware highlighted their sophistication. The breach led to a ripple effect, impacting companies like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3, raising concerns about the extent of the compromise. The aftermath of the breach involved extensive investigations, customer outreach, and security measures to contain the damage. The incident underscored the fragility of digital security and the need for robust defenses against persistent and determined threat actors. The breach, considered a landmark event in cybersecurity history, exposed the risks associated with supply chain attacks and the potential for devastating consequences on global security.





Report 6

Summary:
The Siesta Campaign, orchestrated by threat actor APT 1, targeted institutions in various industries including consumer goods, energy, finance, healthcare, media, telecommunications, public administration, security, defense, transport, and traffic. The threat actor used multi-component malware delivered through spear-phishing emails with legitimate-looking file download links. The malware, identified as BKDR_SLOTH.A and BKDR_SLOTH.B, established connections to newly registered and short-lived command-and-control servers. The malware exhibited behaviors such as sleeping for specified periods and downloading and executing files from URLs. The threat actor used basic social engineering techniques and encrypted commands to maintain persistence and evade detection. The campaign was named "Siesta" due to the malware's dormancy periods. Attribution of the campaign was based on inspecting hashes, C&Cs, registrants, and commands. Trend Micro's Deep Discovery platform was recommended for advanced threat protection against targeted attacks. The threat actor, identified through domain registrations, used the name Li Ning and email address xiaomao@163.com. The campaign highlighted the importance of early detection and mitigation of targeted attacks to prevent data exfiltration.
