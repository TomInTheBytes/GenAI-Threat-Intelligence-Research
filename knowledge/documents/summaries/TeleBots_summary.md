TeleBots, a threat actor group believed to have evolved from the BlackEnergy group, is associated with state-sponsored cyberattacks by the GRU from Russia. Operating primarily in Ukraine, they target high-value sectors such as financial, transportation, and software companies. The group's main motivation is cybersabotage and destruction. They have been observed using a variety of tools including BadRabbit, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and KillDisk. Notable operations include ransomware attacks like XData and NotPetya, as well as supply chain attacks against financial institutions. The group's sophistication and evolution are evident in their ability to target both Windows and Linux systems, showcasing their capability to amplify damage potential. The TeleBots group has been subject to counter operations, with the EU imposing sanctions in 2020 and six Russian GRU officers being charged for their disruptive actions in cyberspace.
