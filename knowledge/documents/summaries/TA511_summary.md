Report 1

The threat actor designated as MAN1, Moskalvzapoe, or TA511 has been using the Hancitor malware, which has evolved to use tools like Cobalt Strike. This threat actor has been targeting victims through malicious Word documents distributed via emails spoofing organizations like DocuSign. The Hancitor infections involve a chain of events starting from a malicious link in an email to the deployment of follow-up malware like Cobalt Strike and Ficker Stealer. Notably, the threat actor has been using a network ping tool since October 2020 to enumerate infected hosts' internal networks, generating significant ICMP traffic. The ping tool scans over 17 million IP addresses of internal, non-routable IPv4 address space, which is highly unusual and noisy. The threat actor behind Hancitor has demonstrated a lack of stealth in deploying this ping tool, making it easily detectable. The use of this novel network ping tool in Hancitor infections with Cobalt Strike showcases the threat actor's evolving capabilities and techniques.

Report 2

TA511, also known as MAN1 or Moskalvzapoe, is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2018. Initially using the relatively unsophisticated information stealer and malware downloader Hancitor, this threat actor has evolved over the years to incorporate tools like Cobalt Strike. In a recent operation in October 2020, TA511 was observed using a network ping tool to enumerate the Active Directory environment of infected hosts, showcasing a novel technique in their arsenal. The threat actor's primary motivation appears to be financial crime, with victims targeted across various sectors in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, and the USA. The threat actor's use of advanced tools and techniques highlights their capability to adapt and remain a persistent threat in the cybersecurity landscape.





Report 3

The threat actor known as Hancitor focuses on distributing banking Trojans through spam campaigns, targeting outdated versions of Microsoft Windows like Windows 7 and XP. The attacks are timed to occur during the middle of the week, showing a pattern of increased activity during that time. The threat actor has adapted their tactics by moving from malicious attachments to malicious downloads, using spam emails with links to download the malware. This shift in technique shows a level of sophistication in evading detection and prevention measures. The threat actor has also globalized their operations, with distribution servers located in various countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, and Vietnam. Despite not being highly advanced, the threat actor's ability to adapt and remain effective poses a global threat for the foreseeable future. The report was published on February 7, 2018, by Palo Alto Networks.
