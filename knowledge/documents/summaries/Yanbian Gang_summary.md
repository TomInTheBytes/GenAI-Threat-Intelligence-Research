Report 2

The threat actor Yanbian Gang, operating from China, has been targeting South Korean Android mobile banking customers since 2013, siphoning millions from over 4,000 victims using fake banking and popular apps. They employed social engineering tactics like using "The Interview" as bait for victims. The group's capability to profit from remote areas showcases their sophistication in financial crime. In 2020, they continued their operations with wide-scale distribution and command-and-control infrastructure. The novelty of their tools and techniques, along with their successful attacks, demonstrate the ongoing threat posed by the Yanbian Gang.
