Report 5

APT 31, also known as Judgment Panda or Zirconium, is a threat actor that has been active in various regions and sectors. Evidence suggests that APT 31 has been targeting victims in the private industry, particularly in the finance and manufacturing sectors. The threat actor has demonstrated a high level of capability through the use of sophisticated tools and techniques, including the creation of descriptive PDB paths during the compilation of malware projects. These PDB paths provide insight into the malware development environment and can be used for detection and hunting purposes. APT 31's use of PDB paths with specific keywords and terms, as well as anomalies like non-ASCII characters, multiple paths in a single file, and nulled out PDB paths, indicates a level of operational indiscretion. The threat actor's naming conventions for malware projects reflect the functionality and role of the malware itself. Offensive teams can manipulate PDB paths to appear more legitimate or introduce intentional artifacts for detection evasion. The presence of PDB paths in malware samples presents an opportunity for detection and analysis, with potential for scaling classification solutions using data science approaches. APT 31's activities have been observed and analyzed by Mandiant, providing valuable insights into the threat landscape.
