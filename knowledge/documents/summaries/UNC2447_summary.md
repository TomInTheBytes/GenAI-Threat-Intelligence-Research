Report 1

UNC2447, a financially motivated threat actor, has been observed by Mandiant targeting organizations in Europe and North America. They have exploited a SonicWall VPN zero-day vulnerability and deployed sophisticated malware known as SOMBRAT, which has been linked to ransomware deployment, a tactic not previously reported publicly. UNC2447 uses FIVEHANDS ransomware to extort victims and applies pressure through threats of media attention and selling victim data on hacker forums. They have advanced capabilities to evade detection and minimize post-intrusion forensics. The threat actor's tools include 7-Zip, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and others. The first sighting of UNC2447 was in 2020, with the latest source modification in May 2021. Their operations demonstrate a novel approach to ransomware deployment and extortion tactics.
