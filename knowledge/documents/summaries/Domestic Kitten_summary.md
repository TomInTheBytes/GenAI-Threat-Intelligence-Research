Summary:
Domestic Kitten, a state-sponsored threat actor from Iran, has been conducting targeted attacks since 2016, primarily focusing on Iranian citizens, Kurdish and Turkish natives, and ISIS supporters. The attackers use mobile applications with spyware to collect sensitive information such as contact lists, phone call records, and geo-location data. The campaign, known as 'Bouncing Golf', has targeted victims in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, UK, USA, and Uzbekistan. The threat actor has been observed using tools like FurBall and GolfSpy, with the most recent operation in November 2020 affecting over 1,200 individuals. The novelty of the tools and techniques used by Domestic Kitten, such as the new FurBall malware, demonstrates their evolving capabilities in information theft and espionage. The threat actor's sophisticated deception tactics and extensive data collection highlight the ongoing threat posed by Domestic Kitten to targeted individuals and organizations.





Report 2

Summary:
The Domestic Kitten campaign, conducted by the APT-C-50 group, has been targeting Iranian citizens with a new version of the FurBall malware since at least 2016. The malware is distributed as an Android translation app through a copycat website that mimics a legitimate Iranian site. The FurBall malware has surveillance functionality, with the latest version featuring obfuscated class and method names to avoid detection by security software. The malware requests intrusive permissions to access contacts, potentially as a precursor to spearphishing attacks. The threat actor behind the campaign has been active in mobile surveillance operations against Iranian citizens for several years, with the latest version of FurBall continuing to exfiltrate data from affected phones. The campaign is ongoing, with the threat actor using copycat websites to distribute the malware and implementing simple obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The malware communicates with a command and control server over HTTP protocol, with the latest samples showing decreased detection rates due to obfuscation. The operator's goal has shifted towards distributing a lighter variant of the malware to avoid detection and gather data from victims.





Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor "Domestic Kitten" conducted a mobile cyberespionage campaign named "Bouncing Golf" targeting Middle Eastern countries, affecting over 660 Android devices with malware AndroidOS_GolfSpy.HRX. The malware had extensive cyberespionage capabilities, stealing military-related information. The attack vector involved repackaging legitimate apps with malicious code not found on popular app marketplaces. The stolen data included device accounts, call logs, location, and more. The malware used unique identifiers for different data types and encrypted stolen data before sending it to a remote server. The threat actor attempted to cover their tracks by masking C&C server details and using disparate IP addresses. The campaign showed similarities to another campaign named Domestic Kitten, indicating a possible connection. The threat landscape suggests an increase in mobile cyberespionage campaigns, emphasizing the need for mobile security solutions. The report provides indicators of compromise for reference.
