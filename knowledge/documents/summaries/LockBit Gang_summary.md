The script, when executed, deploys the 'LockBit Locker' ransomware to encrypt files, showcasing a high level of sophistication. The ransomware gang behind this campaign claims affiliation with LockBit but is believed to be using the leaked LockBit 3.0 ransomware builder. The ransomware executable has been identified as BlackMatter, a ransomware operation that rebranded as ALPHV/BlackCat. The threat actors negotiate via email or the Tox messaging platform, using different lures for companies in various sectors. The use of convincing social engineering tactics and phishing emails poses a significant threat, as it allows threat actors to bypass anti-phishing training and pose as legitimate customers to gain access to target systems. The campaign highlights the evolving tactics and capabilities of threat actors in conducting ransomware attacks.
