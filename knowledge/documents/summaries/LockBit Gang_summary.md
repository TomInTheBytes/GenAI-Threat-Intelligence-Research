Report 58

LockBit ransomware, a threat actor operating in the cybersecurity sector, has been identified as a fast-moving and stealthy attacker. The ransomware is capable of deploying its encryption routine on target systems within five minutes of landing on the victim network. LockBit, which entered the ransomware-as-a-service business in September 2019, utilizes automated processes for rapid spreading and identification of valuable systems for encryption. The threat actor leaves minimal traces for forensic analysis by loading into system memory and removing logs and supporting files upon execution.

The National Police of Spain has issued a warning about a sophisticated 'LockBit Locker' ransomware campaign targeting architecture companies in the country through phishing emails. The threat actors impersonate a photography store and engage in detailed communications with victims before sending a malicious Python script disguised as renovation project documents. The script, when executed, deploys the 'LockBit Locker' ransomware to encrypt files, showcasing a high level of sophistication. The ransomware gang behind this campaign claims affiliation with LockBit but is believed to be using the leaked LockBit 3.0 ransomware builder. The ransomware executable has been identified as BlackMatter, a ransomware operation that rebranded as ALPHV/BlackCat. The threat actors negotiate via email or the Tox messaging platform, using different lures for companies in various sectors. The use of convincing social engineering tactics and phishing emails poses a significant threat, as it allows threat actors to bypass anti-phishing training and pose as legitimate customers to gain access to target systems. The campaign highlights the evolving tactics and capabilities of threat actors in conducting ransomware attacks.
