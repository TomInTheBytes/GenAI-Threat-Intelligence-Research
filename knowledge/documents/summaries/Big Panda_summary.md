Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Big Panda" has been identified by CrowdStrike as part of their active defense platform called Falcon. CrowdStrike has categorized attackers into adversary groups based on country characteristics, with "pandas" representing groups operating from China. The tools and techniques used by Big Panda are novel, with the threat actor launching 124 attacks over six months, some aimed at building deep-sea capabilities. CrowdStrike's platform aims to help businesses identify intrusions in real-time, attribute attacks, and block or engage in counterintelligence against attackers. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by successful spear-phishing attacks against high-profile targets. CrowdStrike recommends using intelligence on online adversaries to focus on specific attackers rather than trying to defend against everything. The report does not specify a specific region, operating sector, or type of company targeted by Big Panda. The operation time window is not provided in the report.
