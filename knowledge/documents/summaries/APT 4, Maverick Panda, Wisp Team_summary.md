Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor APT 4, also known as Maverick Panda or Wisp Team, has been observed targeting victims in the aerospace and military industries, particularly those related to US drones. The threat actor has been active since 2007 and has used known zero-day exploits in combination with the Sykipot malware to launch targeted attacks. The threat actor's campaigns involve sending malicious attachments or links via email to key employees of organizations. Evidence suggests that the threat actor has been running a campaign related to US unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) since at least 2011. The threat actor uses C&C servers, often located in the US but masked through hacked servers, to communicate with infected systems. The threat actor has been observed using Chinese IP addresses to proxy connections and host C&C servers. The tools and techniques used by the threat actor, including the Netbox webserver, suggest a Chinese origin. The threat actor's activities demonstrate a focus on collecting information from targeted victims across various industries, indicating a sophisticated and persistent threat. The threat actor's use of encryption and Chinese language elements further support the attribution to Chinese actors. The threat actor's activities highlight the ongoing cyber warfare landscape and the need for vigilance in cybersecurity defenses.





Report 3

APT 4, also known as Maverick Panda and Wisp Team, is a threat actor targeting organizations in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Evidence suggests that APT 4 has targeted an Asian airline company and public key infrastructure targets using well-researched spear-phishing attacks. The threat actor is known for using novel techniques such as leveraging industry-themed spear-phishes and targeting public key infrastructure. APT 4's attack style is effective despite being sloppier than other threat actors, with a focus on gaining access through successful spear-phishing attacks. The group's capabilities were demonstrated in a breach of an Asian airline company and their use of well-researched spear-phishing techniques. The threat actor's activities have been observed in the second quarter of the year, indicating recent and ongoing operations. The report also highlights the rise of diverse threat actors in the APT space, with countries like Iran, North Korea, and Syria emerging as new players alongside China. The threat landscape in the region is evolving, with APT 4 demonstrating a high level of capability and sophistication in their attacks.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor APT 4, also known as Maverick Panda or Wisp Team, has been targeting the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and government organizations, focusing on exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. They have targeted sectors such as federal agencies and government organizations. The threat actor has demonstrated high skill levels in exploiting vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Excel, Adobe Reader, and Internet Explorer. They have used novel techniques such as spear-phishing campaigns with links instead of attachments to exploit vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Java. The threat actor has also targeted victims using PDF exploits, with a recent focus on Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The threat actor has established a wide range of malicious domains and email addresses for their operations. The report provides detailed information on the infrastructure, campaigns, and vulnerabilities exploited by the threat actor. The report was published on March 21, 2013, by Jaime Blasco.

Malformed report





Report 6

Summary:
APT 4, also known as Maverick Panda or Wisp Team, has resurfaced with a new wave of Sykipot campaigns targeting victims mainly in the US. The threat actor has shifted from using file-format exploits to drive-by-download exploits like CVE-2011-0611 and the Windows XML Core zero-day vulnerability. The group behind the attacks hacks US-based servers to serve malicious content or redirect connections to a remote server. The malware continues to use SSL for communication with the C&C server and has updated its configuration format to support various commands. Known Sykipot domains used for malicious activities include newcarstyle.com and nhrasurvey.org. The threat actor's capabilities include executing commands, retrieving network information, and deleting files from infected systems. The novelty lies in the use of new exploits and updated techniques to evade detection. The report was published on July 2, 2012, by Jaime Blasco.





Report 7

APT 4, also known as Maverick Panda or Wisp Team, targeted victims in the defense sector, mainly in the US, since around 2007. The threat actor, originating from servers in China, focused on obtaining information from the defense sector, particularly targeting companies that extensively use PC/SC x509 Smartcards for authentication. In March 2011, a variant of the Sykipot malware was discovered with new capabilities to hijack DOD and Windows smart cards. The malware, distributed through spear phishing campaigns, utilized a keylogger to steal PINs for the smart cards, allowing the threat actor to access sensitive information when the card was inserted into the reader. The attackers controlled the malware from a command and control center, demonstrating advanced techniques to bypass two-factor authentication systems. This novel approach highlights the evolving tactics of threat actors to overcome increasingly sophisticated defenses, posing a significant risk to organizations, especially those in the defense sector. The report provides detailed technical insights into the malware's functionality, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures to counter such threats effectively.
