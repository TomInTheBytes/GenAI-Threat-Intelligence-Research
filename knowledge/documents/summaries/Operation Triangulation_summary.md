Report 3

Summary:
The report details the Operation Triangulation attack targeting iPhones and iPads, utilizing a 0-click iMessage attack with four zero-day vulnerabilities. The attack chain involves exploiting hardware features to bypass security protections, including an undocumented Apple-only feature. The attackers used a custom hash algorithm and hardware registers to gain control over the device's physical memory. The report raises questions about the origin and purpose of the hardware feature and suggests a potential backdoor. The researchers discovered the attack through reverse engineering and plan to release detailed vulnerability information. The report highlights the sophistication of the attack and the challenges in detecting and mitigating such threats.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor behind "Operation Triangulation" targeted iOS devices with previously unknown malware, identified by Kaspersky researchers. The attack involved a sophisticated campaign that exploited vulnerabilities in iOS devices, allowing for code execution and privilege escalation. The malware used a series of stages to download a final payload from a command and control server, creating a fully-featured APT platform. The attack did not support persistence due to OS limitations, potentially leading to reinfection after device reboot. The campaign was ongoing as of June 2023, targeting iOS 15.7 devices. The analysis of the final payload revealed root-level privileges and the ability to collect system and user information. The attack was conducted through iMessage attachments and involved a network of C&C domains. The report provides detailed forensic methodology for identifying compromise on iOS devices. The latest version of iOS targeted was 15.7, with potential implications for other versions. The report highlights the need for vigilance and prompt system updates to mitigate the threat.

Report 7

Summary:
The threat actor behind "Operation Triangulation" targeted iOS devices, utilizing a stealthy infection chain involving two validation components, JavaScript Validator, and Binary Validator. The threat actor demonstrated a high level of sophistication by implementing modules for microphone recording, keychain exfiltration, SQLite data stealing, and location monitoring. The threat actor showed a deep understanding of iOS internals and used private APIs, targeting both iOS and macOS systems. The operation was executed with a high degree of stealth, with careful deletion of logs and files to avoid detection. The threat actor's use of MD5 hashes for Apple IDs and personalized ad tracking raised questions about their operational security. The report provides indicators of compromise for key modules used in the attack. The operation was detailed in a blog post by Kaspersky researchers, showcasing the novel tools and techniques employed by the threat actor.
