Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor "REvil" ransomware group, also known as "Sodinokibi," persisted despite high-profile arrests of alleged members by Russian authorities. The availability of malicious files and implants associated with REvil increased modestly after the arrests, contradicting claims by the Russian government that the group had ceased to exist. REvil targeted larger organizations capable of paying multi-million dollar ransoms, shifting from commodity attacks to sophisticated campaigns. The group's resilience was evident in previous instances where it appeared to retreat but reemerged stronger. Coordinated government takedowns had only temporary impacts on REvil's operations. The recent arrests by the Russian FSB did not lead to a noticeable decline in REvil implants. The persistence of REvil-linked malicious files highlights gaps in enforcement and the need for improved security measures. Organizations should focus on enhancing internal security and threat modeling to combat ransomware threats like REvil. Further research is needed to fully understand the activities of malware gangs like REvil. The report was published on January 26, 2022.

Report 19

Summary:
The threat actor known as REvil, also referred to as Sodinokibi, has faced significant disruptions to its operations, leading to questions about its future. REvil established itself as a dominant ransomware-as-a-service operation, recruiting affiliates to infect victims and share ransom payments. Recent disruptions to REvil's infrastructure, including the disappearance of key administrators and the exposure of a backdoor allowing administrators to keep 100% of ransom payments, have tarnished its reputation. Law enforcement efforts have intensified to disrupt ransomware operators, potentially impacting REvil's ability to operate. The future of REvil remains uncertain, with speculation about a potential rebranding or comeback under a new name. The ransomware landscape continues to evolve, with affiliates working across multiple operations, indicating that the disappearance of one group may not significantly impact the overall ransomware threat.





Report 20

Summary:
The threat actor known as REvil, previously inactive, has resurfaced with new ransomware operations, redirecting from their TOR sites to a new operation. The new operation, promoted on a Russian-speaking forum, offers an improved version of REvil ransomware and an 80/20 split for affiliates. Evidence suggests a connection to REvil, with leaked data from old victims and new ones, including Oil India. The new operation's blog and payment sites are active, with the blog dropping a cookie named DEADBEEF. The redirect from REvil's original sites to the new operation indicates a change in control, possibly by someone other than law enforcement. Speculation surrounds the legitimacy of the new operation, with theories of it being a scam, honeypot, or a continuation of REvil's business.

The threat actor, referred to as GOLD SOUTHFIELD, continued to push new releases of REvil monthly, indicating a structured development process. The threat actor's capabilities were demonstrated through expanded delivery methods such as malicious spam campaigns and RDP attacks. Notable attacks include a strategic web compromise against an Italian website and breaches of managed service providers in the United States. Evidence suggests a technical connection between GandCrab and REvil, with similarities in string decoding functions and URL building logic. The threat actor's operational security mistakes enabled researchers to link the two ransomware families. The threat actor's region whitelisting practices indicate a likely connection between the developers of GandCrab and REvil. The report was published on September 24, 2019, by Secureworks.





Report 22

Summary: The threat actor known as REvil Ransomware, operated by Pinchy Spider and Gold Southfield, has developed a new capability to reboot infected devices after encryption.

The threat actor targets organizations primarily through compromised RDP sessions and phishing attacks, with recent high-profile attacks on Acer and Travelex. The gang has been evolving its malware and extortion tactics, targeting larger organizations and publicly naming victims on a dedicated leak site. The increase in attacks is attributed to the growing number of affiliates under its ransomware-as-a-service model. The threat actor's activities are primarily focused on the USA, UK, Europe, India, and Asia. The report was published on March 24, 2021, by ISMG Network.





Report 23

Summary:
The REvil ransomware gang, also known as the Sodinokibi REvil ransomware gang, spilled details on US attacks in an interview on the Russian OSINT channel. They initially targeted Brazil-based entities but shifted focus to the US, with recent attacks impacting JBS Foods. The group is known for audacious attacks and high ransoms, such as attempting to extort Apple for $50 million. Despite US intervention and legislation against ransom payments, the group remains undeterred and lifted restrictions on attacking US targets. The Biden administration has engaged with Russia on the matter, emphasizing that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals. The REvil gang's capability to target large organizations and their willingness to escalate attacks on US targets demonstrate their threat actor capabilities. The use of the Russian OSINT channel for communication and the group's defiance towards US actions highlight the novelty of their tools and techniques. (Date: June 4, 2021)





Report 24

Summary:
A threat actor claiming to be associated with the infamous ransomware group REvil launched a distributed denial of service (DDoS) campaign against an Akamai customer in the hospitality sector on May 12, 2022. The attack involved overwhelming the website with HTTP/2 GET requests containing demands for payment and business/political demands.
