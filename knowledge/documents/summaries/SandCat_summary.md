Report 1

Summary:
A new threat actor named SandCat, believed to be Uzbekistan's intelligence agency, was uncovered due to poor operational security practices. The group made multiple mistakes, including using a military group's name to register a domain, installing Kaspersky antivirus on machines used for malware development, and embedding screenshots of their developer's machines in test files. SandCat was found to have purchased four zero-day exploits, which were rendered ineffective due to their poor OPSEC. The group's activities were linked to the State Security Service (SSS) of Uzbekistan, known for its oppressive tactics. SandCat's capabilities were exposed by Kaspersky researchers in October 2018, revealing their use of zero-day exploits and development of a new attack platform called Sharpa. The group's mistakes, arrogance, and inexperience led to their exposure, but it is expected that they will improve their operational security in response to being discovered.





Report 2

SandCat is a state-sponsored threat actor, operating under Military Unit 02616 from Uzbekistan. First observed in 2018, they have been using FinFisher/FinSpy spyware, the CHAINSHOT framework, and various zero-day exploits in their attacks. Their targets have primarily been in the Middle East, with a focus on Saudi Arabia. The group's motivation is information theft and espionage. SandCat's use of novel tools and techniques, along with their affiliation with a military unit, indicates a high level of capability. The threat actor's activities have been ongoing, with the latest source modification in April 2020.





Report 3

Summary:
- Threat actors SandCat and FruityArmor are actively exploiting the Microsoft Win32k flaw CVE-2019-0797.
- SandCat is a newly discovered APT group targeting victims in the Middle East, using FinFisher/FinSpy spyware and the CHAINSHOT framework.
- FruityArmor is an under-the-radar cyber-espionage group also active in the Middle East, known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
- The exploit targets 64-bit operating systems from Windows 8 to Windows 10 build 15063.
- Both APTs are selectively choosing high-value targets in surgical campaigns.
- The vulnerability allows attackers to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to data manipulation or account creation.
- The flaw was reported to Microsoft on Feb. 22 and patched in the March security update.
- The threat actors' capability to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities and use advanced spyware tools demonstrates their sophistication.
- The novel technique involves a race condition in the Win32k driver, allowing attackers to execute system calls simultaneously.
- The targeted victims are mainly located in the Middle East, with journalists and activists also being targeted.
