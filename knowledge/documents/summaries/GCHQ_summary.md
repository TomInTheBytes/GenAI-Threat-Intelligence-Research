Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor identified as GCHQ, a British government spy agency, conducted a hacking operation codenamed Operation Socialist against Belgium's largest telecommunications provider, Belgacom, between 2010 and 2011. The attack involved the use of highly sophisticated malware named "Regin," which disguised itself as legitimate Microsoft software to steal data. The attack targeted Belgacom's internal systems, compromising over 120 computer systems, including routers at the core of the company's networks. The malware was described as one of the most advanced ever seen by security researchers. GCHQ used techniques like Quantum Insert attacks to infect Belgacom engineers' computers and gain access to the company's networks. The attack was discovered in 2013, leading to an investigation by Belgacom, Dutch security firm Fox-IT, and Belgian authorities. Despite cleanup efforts, sources familiar with the investigation believe parts of the malware were never fully removed. The attack raised concerns about state-sponsored hacking and espionage, with implications for international telecommunications networks. GCHQ declined to comment on the operation, citing legal and necessary actions. The attack was linked to GCHQ through evidence found in Snowden documents and malware analysis. Belgacom's response to the attack and cleanup efforts have been questioned, with doubts raised about the thoroughness of the removal of the malware. The attack on Belgacom represents a significant example of state-sponsored hacking targeting critical infrastructure and private communications. The operation was conducted with significant resources and involved novel techniques and tools, showcasing the capabilities of the threat actor. The attack was revealed in 2013, leading to investigations and public scrutiny of the incident.
