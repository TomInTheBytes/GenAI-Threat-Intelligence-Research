Report 2

The Winnti Group, specifically the subgroup Wicked Panda, targeted German chemicals giant Bayer in early 2018 using Winnti malware, which was also detected at three other smaller companies in Germany. The attack was part of a rising wave of cyberattacks worrying firms. The evidence gathered by the DCSO cybersecurity group, which includes German companies like Allianz, BASF, and Volkswagen, pointed towards the Wicked Panda group in China. Bayer, Germany's largest drugmaker, covertly monitored and analyzed the attack until March 2019, clearing the threat from its systems with no evidence of data theft. The threat actor's capability was demonstrated by targeting critical infrastructure companies in Germany, including steel production and manufacturing plants, resulting in technical trade secrets being stolen. The attack on Bayer is part of a larger trend of Chinese cyber espionage targeting German companies, with mounting fears of Chinese hackers targeting construction, materials research, engineering firms, and big commercial enterprises.

Report 4

Summary:
The Winnti Group, along with other APT groups like LuckyMouse, Tick, and Calypso, targeted Exchange servers globally using recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. The exploitation started before the patch release on 2021-03-02, with evidence of webshells on over 5,000 email servers. Multiple APT groups gained access to the vulnerabilities before the patch release, indicating advanced capabilities. Novel techniques included the use of webshells, backdoors, and malware implants to compromise victims' email servers. The threat actors targeted various sectors, including governmental entities, private companies, and critical infrastructure. The threat actors demonstrated a high level of sophistication and coordination in exploiting the vulnerabilities. The operation timeframe ranged from early January to early March 2021.





Report 5

Summary:
The Winnti Group, known for targeting gaming companies, has expanded its scope to include pharmaceutical companies, as evidenced by a recent sample of Winnti malware. The group, previously associated with cyber-espionage in the gaming industry, has now been linked to attacks on telecoms and big pharma companies. The new sample, Winnti 3.0, includes a worker library with encrypted configuration blocks targeting a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Europe. The presence of malicious Winnti network rootkits signed with stolen certificates indicates a shift towards targeting industries beyond gaming. The evidence suggests that Winnti is evolving and poses a threat to a wider range of sectors. The report was published on June 22, 2015, by Dmitry Tarakanov on Securelist.





Report 6

The Winnti Group, Blackfly, and Wicked Panda threat actors targeted the steel giant Thyssenkrupp in Germany in a cyber attack on December 8, 2016. The hackers stole technical trade secrets from the steel production and manufacturing plant design divisions of Thyssenkrupp. The breaches were discovered in April and traced back to February, with the attackers identified as organized and highly professional hackers from southeast Asia. The attacks affected sites in Europe, India, Argentina, and the US. Thyssenkrupp reported the incidents to the police in North Rhine-Westphalia and cleansed the infected computer systems. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the successful theft of project data and the sophisticated nature of the attacks. The use of novel techniques and tools in the cyber attacks highlights the advanced capabilities of the threat actor.

Report 8

Summary:
The threat actor Winnti Group, also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly, is a highly sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored organization targeting various industries, including gaming, chemical, pharmaceutical, technology, and software sectors in Europe and South Asia. In January 2020, a new Winnti sample was detected targeting a German chemical company, using a previously unreported DNS tunneling technique through iodine source code. Additionally, a stolen digital certificate from IQ Technology was used to sign Winnti-related attack components. The threat actor also targeted a South Korean video game company, Gravity Co., Ltd., with a Winnti dropper executable. The Winnti Group's evolving tactics and tools, such as the use of DNS tunneling and stolen digital certificates, demonstrate their advanced capabilities and commitment to conducting espionage and financially motivated attacks. The threat actor's operations span back to at least 2010, with a focus on the gaming industry initially and later expanding to other sectors. The report provides detailed technical analysis, indicators of compromise, and recommended courses of action to defend against Winnti Group attacks. The threat actor's activities pose a significant risk to organizations, especially small to medium-sized companies, emphasizing the importance of implementing robust security measures to mitigate threats.

Report 10

Summary:
The Winnti Group, a sophisticated threat actor believed to be controlled by China, has been conducting espionage on businesses globally, with a focus on Germany and its DAX corporations. The group uses highly complex malware to spy on corporate networks, targeting at least six DAX corporations in Germany. Evidence suggests that Winnti has evolved from cybercrime to industrial espionage, targeting high-tech, chemical, and pharmaceutical companies in Germany, Japan, France, and the U.S. The group's tools and techniques, including malware variants and network infiltration methods, have been analyzed by IT security experts, revealing a lack of operational security (Opsec) and persistence in network infiltration. The German Cyber Security Organization (DCSO) believes Winnti is closely linked to the Chinese government, with indicators pointing towards political espionage beyond traditional industrial targets. The German government and intelligence agencies are actively monitoring and responding to Winnti's activities, with concerns about the group's ties to the Chinese government and the implications of cyberattacks on national security. The investigation, conducted by Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR) and Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), sheds light on the extensive and ongoing cyber threats posed by the Winnti Group to various sectors and regions.





Report 11

The Winnti Group, also known as Blackfly and Wicked Panda, has been active since 2013, targeting a diverse set of victims for various motivations. In April 2019, a German Pharmaceutical company fell victim to Winnti malware. The threat actor has shown capability in compromising Windows-based environments and has recently expanded into Linux tooling, indicating a shift in their traditional comfort zone. The Linux variant of Winnti uses a userland rootkit to hide its activity on infected systems and has a secondary communication channel that allows operators to connect directly to infected hosts. This feature serves as a failsafe secondary command-and-control mechanism. The threat actor's use of novel techniques, such as a passive listener for communication, demonstrates their foresight in maintaining network persistence. The Winnti Group's activity is ongoing and continues to be of interest to researchers.





Report 12

Summary:
The Winnti Group, known for traditional cybercrime activities, has been observed abusing GitHub for command and control (C&C) communications using a new backdoor named BKDR64_WINNTI.ONM. The threat actor has been found using GitHub to host HTML pages for C&C communications, with evidence of the use of PlugX malware variants in their operations. The malware analyzed consists of a loader and payload, with unique encryption algorithms used to store C&C references. The threat actor's GitHub account was created in May 2016, with the campaign timeline spanning from August 2016 to March 2017. The C&C servers used by Winnti are primarily hosted in the U.S. and Japan, communicating over ports 53, 80, and 443. The threat actor's use of GitHub showcases a novel tactic to maintain network persistence and evade detection. The report includes related hashes of the detected malware.
