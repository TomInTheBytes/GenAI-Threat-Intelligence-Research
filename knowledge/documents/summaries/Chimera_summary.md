Chimera, a threat actor believed to be based in China, has been targeting Taiwan's semiconductor vendors since 2018. The attacks involved the use of phishing emails and data breaches to harvest valid credentials, followed by the deployment of Cobalt Strike as a Remote Access Tool (RAT) disguised as a Google Chrome Update. The actor also utilized a novel malware called SkeletonKeyInjector to implant a general key for LM, persistence, and defense evasion. The motive behind these attacks appears to be information theft and espionage, with a focus on harvesting company trade secrets in sectors such as aviation and high-tech. The threat actor's operations have been linked to specific incidents, such as the looting of secrets from chipmaker NXP over a period of two years. The use of advanced tools like Cobalt Strike and SkeletonKeyInjector, along with the actor's ability to evade detection by hosting C2 servers in public cloud services, demonstrates their sophisticated capabilities. The threat actor's activities have been monitored by cybersecurity firms like NCC Group and Fox-IT, indicating ongoing efforts to track and counter their operations.





Report 2

Summary:
A threat actor group known as "Chimera" with ties to China conducted a sophisticated espionage campaign targeting the corporate network of NXP, a chipmaker based in the Netherlands, from late 2017 to early 2020. The threat actors accessed employee mailboxes and network drives to steal chip designs and intellectual property. They used cloud services like Microsoft and Dropbox to exfiltrate stolen data. NXP did not disclose the breach to customers until a brief mention in a 2019 annual report. The threat actor group has a history of targeting various companies and used novel techniques like leveraging account information from previous data breaches to compromise victims. The intrusion had the potential to impact the security of products like iPhones, Apple watches, and electric vehicles that use NXP chips. The threat actor's capability to bypass multi-factor authentication and steal sensitive data poses a significant risk to targeted companies. The incident highlights the need for continuous strengthening of IT systems to defend against evolving cybersecurity threats.
