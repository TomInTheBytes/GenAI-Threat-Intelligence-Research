Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Cloud Atlas, linked to the RedOctober APT group, resurfaced in August 2014 targeting diplomatic entities with a variation of CVE-2012-0158 and unique malware. The group's capability was evidenced by the use of encrypted Visual Basic Scripts instead of traditional Windows PE backdoors. The malware utilized a complex C&C communication mechanism via HTTPS and WebDav with a cloud service provider, CloudMe. The group targeted Russia and Kazakhstan, showing similarities with the RedOctober operation in terms of targets and malware constructs. The novel techniques and tools used by Cloud Atlas, along with the geographical overlap with RedOctober victims, suggest a resurgence of the RedOctober attacks. The report was published on December 10, 2014, by Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT).





Report 3

Summary:
The cyber-espionage group Cloud Atlas, a state-backed threat actor active since at least 2014, targeted Russian companies in a new campaign involving war-related phishing attacks. The attacks were aimed at a Russian agro-industrial enterprise and a state-owned research company. The hackers sent phishing emails with malicious attachments, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) to gain access to victims' systems. Cloud Atlas has previously targeted organizations in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Slovenia, focusing on espionage and theft of confidential information. The group's tactics include crafting phishing emails to mimic government statements, media articles, and business proposals. The attacks were detected and blocked by researchers, with evidence pointing to the group's continued activity and sophistication in targeting high-profile victims in the region. The group's sponsorship remains unclear. The report was released on December 21st, 2023, by the Russian cybersecurity firm F.A.C.C.T. and highlights the ongoing threat posed by Cloud Atlas in the cyber landscape.

Report 5

The threat actor known as "Inception Framework, Cloud Atlas" has been targeting European victims since at least 2014, primarily in the government sector. They have been using a new PowerShell backdoor called POWERSHOWER along with exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The attackers have been observed using remote templates in Microsoft Word documents to deliver malicious payloads, making analysis difficult. The POWERSHOWER backdoor is designed to clean up after itself, removing forensic evidence and establishing a foothold for further attacks. The threat actor's use of anti-forensics techniques and basic malware like POWERSHOWER as a first stage makes it challenging for researchers to analyze their activities. The latest attacks were observed in October 2018, targeting European victims with a focus on espionage activities. The threat actor's capability to evade detection and use novel techniques like remote templates and POWERSHOWER showcases their sophistication and adaptability.





Report 6

Inception Framework, also known as Cloud Atlas, is a threat actor that has been active since 2012, with evidence of highly targeted attacks primarily focused on individuals in strategic positions in sectors such as aerospace, defense, energy, finance, and government. The threat actor has shown masterful identity cloaking and diversionary tactics, clean and elegant code suggesting top-tier talent, and the use of malware targeting mobile devices. They have been observed using a free cloud hosting service for command and control and have expanded their targets globally beyond Russia. The motivation behind their attacks is information theft and espionage, with reported hacking operations such as "RedOctober" in 2012 and "Cloud Atlas" in 2014. The threat actor has been observed using novel tools and techniques, including polymorphic infection chains and PowerShell backdoors. Their operations have targeted countries across the world, with recent campaigns focusing on entities in Russia and Belarus amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.





Report 7

Summary:
The threat actor known as Cloud Atlas, also referred to as Inception, has been engaging in cyber-espionage operations targeting industries and governmental entities in Russia, Central Asia, and regions of Ukraine with ongoing military conflicts. The threat actor has been active since 2014 and has been using spear-phishing campaigns to compromise high-value targets. Cloud Atlas has not changed its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) since 2018 and continues to rely on existing malware to carry out its operations. The threat actor utilizes tools like the "PowerShower" implant, which is a malicious PowerShell designed to execute various modules on the local computer. Recently, Cloud Atlas has introduced a new polymorphic infection chain involving a backdoor named "VBShower" to complicate forensic analysis and evade IoC-based defense mechanisms. Despite being active in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Cloud Atlas has not adopted open-source implants and has maintained its modular backdoor for five years. The threat actor's campaigns remain prolific and effective in compromising targets through spear-phishing. The report provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to the threat actor's recent activities.





Report 8

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Inception Framework, Cloud Atlas" was involved in a cyber espionage campaign named "Red October" targeting diplomatic, governmental, and scientific research organizations in Eastern Europe, former USSR members, and countries in Central Asia. The campaign, active since 2007, aimed to gather intelligence from compromised organizations using advanced cyber-espionage techniques. The threat actor demonstrated a unique architecture with a multi-functional kit capable of stealing data from various devices, including smartphones and network equipment. The attackers imported exploit code for vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Excel, possibly to obfuscate their activities. The threat actor's origins were believed to be Russian-speaking based on registration data and artifacts found in the malware. The campaign utilized a complex command and control infrastructure with over 60 domains and servers acting as proxies. The threat actor's capability to maintain access to infected machines and the reuse of stolen credentials in later attacks showcased their sophistication. The report was based on an investigation conducted by Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team in January 2013.
