Report 1

The Chinese threat actor Scarab has been targeting Ukraine, with the recent activity being associated with UAC-0026, as confirmed by SentinelLabs and Ukraine CERT. Scarab has a history of campaigns using custom backdoors like Scieron and HeaderTip, with phishing emails containing lure documents being a common tactic. The recent activity by UAC-0026 represents the first public example of a Chinese threat actor targeting Ukraine since the invasion began. Evidence links UAC-0026 to Scarab APT through malware samples and infrastructure, indicating high confidence in the attribution. The threat actor's use of lure documents themed around geopolitical events and specific language settings suggests Chinese-speaking origins and geopolitical intelligence collection purposes. The malware used, HeaderTip, is a 32-bit DLL file with limited functionality, making HTTP POST requests to a C2 server. Scarab's use of dynamic DNS services complicates attribution but indicates a standard operating toolkit approach. The recent attack on Ukraine by Scarab APT represents a novel threat from a non-Russian APT, with further objectives and motivations remaining unclear.
