Report 2

Equation Group, a state-sponsored threat actor believed to be tied to the NSA's Tailored Access Operations unit, has been active since at least 2001. They have targeted victims in various sectors such as Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government, and Telecommunications, operating in countries like Iran, Russia, and Pakistan. The group's capabilities include using virtual file systems, stashing malicious files in multiple branches of a computer's registry, and bypassing code-signing restrictions in Windows. They have also used USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks and redirected iPhone users to unique exploit web pages. Equation Group's sophisticated techniques and resources have led researchers to consider them one of the most advanced cyber attack groups globally, comparable to those behind Stuxnet and Flame malware. In 2016, their arsenal of 0-day cyber weapons was stolen by the Shadow Brokers group, leading to the leak of tools like ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE, which were later used in ransomware attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya.





Report 3

The Equation Group, a highly sophisticated threat actor suspected to be tied to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the United States National Security Agency (NSA), is classified as an advanced persistent threat. Operating in countries such as Iran, Russia, Pakistan, and India, they are known for their use of advanced encryption techniques and malware like EquationDrug and GrayFish capable of reprogramming hard disk drive firmware. The group has been active since at least 2001, with more than 60 actors, and has been linked to the creators of Stuxnet and Flame. In 2016, a hacking group called "The Shadow Brokers" announced they had stolen malware code from the Equation Group, leading to the exposure of exploits against Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances and Fortinet's firewalls. The Equation Group's tools and techniques, including the ability to infect hard drive firmware and use hidden disk areas, demonstrate a high level of sophistication and capability. The novelty of their tools, such as the use of zero-day exploits and the creation of hidden disk areas, sets them apart as one of the most advanced cyber attack groups in the world.

Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Equation Group" has been active since at least 2001, with evidence of intercepting packages in transit to deliver malicious payloads. They have infected at least 500 victims in 42 countries, with a focus on regions like Iran, Russia, and Pakistan. Their capabilities include using advanced techniques like virtual file systems, registry encryption, and USB stick-based reconnaissance malware for air-gapped networks. The group has been linked to the NSA based on shared code words, keyloggers, and zero-day vulnerabilities used in their operations. Their engineering skills are highlighted by the ability to rewrite hard-drive firmware, creating a secret storage vault that survives disk wiping and reformatting. The Equation Group is considered one of the most sophisticated threat actors in the world, with resources comparable to those behind Stuxnet and Flame malware. The report was published on February 16, 2015, by Ars Technica.
