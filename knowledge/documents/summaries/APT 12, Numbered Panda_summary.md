Report 1

Numbered Panda, also known as APT 12, is a state-sponsored threat actor originating from China, with a history of targeting high-profile victims in sectors such as defense, government, high-tech, media, telecommunications, electronics, and journalists. The threat actor has been active since at least 2009 and has used various aliases such as DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, and APT-12. Numbered Panda's operations have included time-sensitive attacks, such as during the Fukushima Reactor Incident in 2011, where they likely gathered intelligence related to cleanup operations. One of their notable techniques involves dynamically calculating the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS, allowing them to bypass egress filtering. They have used a variety of tools like AUMLIB, ETUMBOT, IHEATE, and WaterSpout in their campaigns. Notable hacking operations include the breach of The New York Times in 2012 and multiple spear-phishing campaigns targeting the Taiwanese Government. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with a focus on stealing sensitive data from their victims. Their use of novel techniques and tools demonstrates their advanced capabilities in cyber espionage.





Report 2

Summary:
- Threat actor: APT 12, Numbered Panda
- Region: Taiwan
- Operating sector: Public service website
- Date: November 7, 2016

Report 4

APT 12, also known as Numbered Panda, is a threat actor believed to have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The group has been targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan, aligning with larger People's Republic of China goals. APT 12 has been observed evolving and adapting its tactics to avoid detection, using tools like the RIPTIDE backdoor, which later evolved into the HIGHTIDE backdoor. The group has also been associated with other backdoors like THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT, targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan. APT 12's use of phishing emails to deliver malware, exploiting CVE-2012-0158, indicates a continued focus on cyber espionage activities. The group's ability to retool and develop new malware tools, such as HIGHTIDE and WATERSPOUT, showcases their capability to adapt and maintain their cyber operations. The report covers activities from August 2014, highlighting APT 12's ongoing efforts to target organizations in the region.





Report 5

Numbered Panda, also known as IXESHE, DynCalc, DNSCALC, and APT12, is a cyber espionage group believed to be linked with the Chinese military. The group typically targets organizations in East Asia, including media outlets, high-tech companies, and governments. Numbered Panda has been operating since 2009 and was credited with a 2012 data breach at the New York Times. The group's typical technique involves sending PDF files loaded with malware via spear phishing campaigns, with decoy documents written in traditional Chinese. Evidence of the group's capability includes the use of malware like Ixeshe and Etumbot, which allow for various malicious activities such as listing services, processes, and drives, downloading and uploading files, and establishing command-and-control servers. The group has shown novelty in its techniques, such as using right-to-left override exploits and changing malware versions like HighTide to evade detection. The report spans from 2009 to 2014, with notable operations targeting East Asian nations, Japan, Taiwan, and the New York Times.





Report 6

Numbered Panda, also known as APT-12, is a threat actor based in China that has targeted high-profile victims including media outlets, high-tech companies, and governments. They have been involved in time-sensitive operations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011. Numbered Panda's weaponization tactics include using screen saver files and PDF documents. One of their novel techniques is dynamically calculating the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS, allowing them to bypass egress filtering. They frequently use blogs or WordPress in their C2 infrastructure to make network traffic appear legitimate. CrowdStrike has observed Numbered Panda targeting high-tech, defense contractors, media organizations, and western governments. Their intrusion detection rules have been developed to detect their activities. The threat actor is known for their sophisticated tactics and has a history of targeting companies in the Chinese market. (Date: March 29, 2013)
