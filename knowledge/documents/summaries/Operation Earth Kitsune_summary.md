Report 1

Earth Kitsune, an advanced persistent threat actor, has been distributing variants of self-developed backdoors to primarily target individuals interested in North Korea since 2019. In a recent operation, Earth Kitsune used a watering hole attack tactic to compromise a pro-North Korean website and distribute a new backdoor named WhiskerSpy. The backdoor was delivered through a trojanized codec installer, utilizing social engineering techniques instead of browser exploits. The threat actor also employed unique persistence techniques, including abusing Google Chrome's native messaging host. The backdoor, WhiskerSpy, uses elliptic-curve cryptography for communication with the command-and-control server and implements various commands for malicious activities. The attack has been attributed to Earth Kitsune with medium confidence based on infrastructure overlaps with previous activities. This operation showcases the threat actor's technical proficiency and continuous evolution of tools and tactics. The report provides indicators of compromise for organizations to defend against such advanced threats.
