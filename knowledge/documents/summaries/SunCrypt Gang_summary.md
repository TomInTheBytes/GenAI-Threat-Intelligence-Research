Report 1

Summary: The SunCrypt Gang, a ransomware operation, has incorporated DDoS attacks into their extortion tactics. In a recent attack, a victim's website was DDoSed after negotiations stalled, leading to increased pressure on the victim to pay the ransom. The threat actor warned the victim that the DDoS attack would continue if negotiations did not resume. This novel tactic proved effective, especially against smaller organizations, ultimately resulting in the victim paying the ransom. The SunCrypt Gang's use of DDoS attacks demonstrates their evolving capabilities and willingness to employ new techniques to coerce victims into paying ransoms.

Report 2

The SunCrypt Gang, a ransomware group first seen in 2019, has recently joined the Maze cartel to target individuals and companies globally for financial gain. The threat actor has been observed using tools like SunCrypt and WARPRISM. They have conducted various hacking operations, including phishing attacks on MU Health Care impacting 5,000 patients, shutting down a North Carolina school district, hitting University Hospital New Jersey with ransomware and leaking data, and attacking a Texas unit of a global steel conglomerate.

Report 3

Summary:
The SunCrypt ransomware has joined the Maze ransomware cartel, revealing insights into their collaboration. SunCrypt operators claim to be independently run but have two-way communication with Maze. Evidence suggests that Maze shares resources with cartel members, possibly providing compromised network access. SunCrypt ransomware is distributed as a DLL and encrypts files, appending a hexadecimal hash to filenames. Victims are directed to a Tor payment site for ransom negotiation. SunCrypt also operates a data leak site. The ransomware is being analyzed for weaknesses, and recovery of files for free is uncertain. Maze operators deny any affiliation with SunCrypt. The report was last updated on August 31, 2020.

Report 4

Summary:
The SunCrypt Gang targeted the Haywood County School District in North Carolina with ransomware, causing a data breach and disrupting remote learning. The attack occurred on August 24th, 2020, and unencrypted data was stolen. The threat actor, SunCrypt Ransomware operators, are known for stealing data before encrypting devices and threatening to release it if a ransom is not paid. They used novel techniques such as creating a PowerShell script named after the victim and pushing it to all Windows devices on the network to quickly encrypt files. The victims were left with encrypted files and ransom notes demanding payment on a Tor payment site. The threat actor's capability to compromise networks and steal data before encryption demonstrates their advanced tactics. The attack highlights the increasing threat of ransomware to the education sector.





Report 5

Summary:
The University Hospital New Jersey was targeted by the SunCrypt ransomware group, resulting in a data breach of 48,000 documents. The hospital, a state-owned teaching hospital in New Jersey, had sensitive information leaked, including patient data and Board of Directors records. The SunCrypt ransomware operation, active since October 2019, has recently increased its activities and released a dedicated leak site. Evidence suggests that an employee at the hospital was infected with TrickBot prior to the ransomware attack, indicating a potential network compromise. The threat actor's capability is demonstrated by the use of novel techniques such as partnering with TrickBot to gain access to compromised networks. The attack occurred in September 2020.





Report 6

Summary: The SunCrypt Gang targeted the Texas unit of the global steel conglomerate JSW Steel using Windows SunCrypt ransomware, leaking a company document on the dark web. The gang also conducted a distributed denial of service attack on the company, a new tactic to pressure victims for ransom. JSW Steel, an Indian-owned group with a market value of US$12 billion, was targeted in Texas, with operations in Ohio as well. SunCrypt, a new player in ransomware, started operations in October last year and previously attacked an Irish company. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the successful attacks on high-value targets in different regions and sectors. The use of novel tactics like DDoS attacks shows the evolving techniques of the threat actor. Date: Not specified.
