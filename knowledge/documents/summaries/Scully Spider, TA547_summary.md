Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as Scully Spider, TA547, has been identified distributing a new banking Trojan called DanaBot targeting users in Australia. The malware is written in Delphi and is still under active development. DanaBot has been observed being spread by a single threat actor, TA547, who is known for purchasing banking Trojans from other developers and operators. The malware was first observed in May 2018 in Australia-targeted email campaigns with malicious URLs leading to the malware. DanaBot includes banking site web injections, stealer functions, and downloader components that download additional modules encrypted with the Microsoft CryptAPI AES256 algorithm. The threat actor, TA547, has been active since at least November 2017 and has been responsible for various campaigns localized in countries such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. DanaBot shows similarities to earlier malware like Reveton and CryptXXX in its technical implementation and communication methods. The malware represents a shift towards less noisy malware like banking Trojans and information stealers, focusing on persistence and stealing valuable information for monetization rather than immediate ransom demands. The modular nature of DanaBot allows for flexibility and robust stealing capabilities. The threat landscape continues to evolve, and monitoring DanaBot's activities will be crucial in understanding the changing tactics of threat actors.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as DanaBot, operated by Scully Spider, TA547, was first detected in May 2018 and is a powerful banking trojan that primarily targets financial services institutions in Australia and Europe. DanaBot has shown rapid growth due to its modularity and distribution methods, similar to Zeus and Gozi banking trojans. In August 2019, DanaBot expanded its targets to include attacks on ecommerce platforms and social media sites, in addition to financial services. The threat actor has been observed using new tactics such as creating fake forms on popular websites and utilizing a ransomware module. DanaBot has also been seen abusing the p.a.c.k.e.r. framework to create a command and control communication mechanism. These novel techniques indicate the threat actor's evolving capabilities and adaptability. The shift in targets and the use of new tools and techniques demonstrate the threat actor's sophistication and readiness for the peak phishing and fraud season. The report provides technical breakdowns of DanaBot's malicious activities, including web injections and obfuscation methods. The threat actor's global reach, targeting American websites like Groupon and eBay, as well as popular ecommerce platforms like AliExpress, highlights the widespread impact of DanaBot's campaigns. The report emphasizes the need for organizations to implement security controls to detect and prevent banking trojan attacks, especially during the holiday season. DanaBot's association with other banking trojans like Gozi and Tinba, as well as its Zeus-like characteristics, indicate its significance in the banking trojan landscape. Organizations are advised to educate customers about the threat of malware infections and implement fraud detection measures to protect against DanaBot's malicious activities.





Report 5

Summary:
The threat actor known as Scully Spider, TA547, has been active since at least November 2017, targeting victims primarily in the financial sector in countries such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The actor has been responsible for distributing various types of malware, including ZLoader, Gootkit, Ursnif, and DanaBot. DanaBot, in particular, has been observed to distribute other malware strains such as CoreBot, GandCrab, and TrickBot. The actor's motivation appears to be financial gain, with evidence of evolving tactics and capabilities, such as the use of new communication protocols and ransom demands. The threat actor's operations have been reported as recently as September 2019, indicating ongoing activity and adaptation to evade detection.
