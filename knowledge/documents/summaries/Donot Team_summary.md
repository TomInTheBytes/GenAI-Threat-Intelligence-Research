Report 2

The threat actor known as APT-C-35, also referred to as the DoNot Team, has been active since at least 2016 and primarily targets individuals and organizations in South Asia, focusing on government and military entities in countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. They are known for using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to initiate attacks, leveraging Microsoft Office macros and RTF files for exploitation. The group's Windows framework, named YTY, Jaca, has been continuously updated with new modules and functionalities, including file collection, keylogging, reverse shell, browser stealing, and system information gathering. The threat actor uses a modular architecture and various programming languages like C++, .NET, and Python in their operations. They also utilize Google Drive for storing command and control server addresses and employ multiple domains for different purposes throughout the infection chain. The DoNot Team has recently introduced new capabilities to their Windows framework, such as a shellcode loader mechanism, an upgraded browser stealer module, and a new DLL variant of the reverse shell. These advancements demonstrate the threat actor's evolving tactics and techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. The group's latest activities, including spear phishing campaigns targeting government departments in South Asia, indicate their ongoing threat to organizations in the region. The report provides detailed insights into the DoNot Team's operations, highlighting the sophistication and novelty of their tools and techniques. Date of report: August 11, 2022.





Report 3

DoNot APT, a threat actor group, recently deployed malicious Android apps on the Google Play Store under the account "SecurITY Industry". The apps, Device Basic Plus, nSure Chat, and iKHfaa VPN, targeted individuals in the Pakistan region. The threat actor used innocent Android libraries to fetch contacts and locations of victims, indicating a motive for information gathering. The apps were found to have malicious characteristics, with iKHfaa VPN copying code from a genuine VPN provider and injecting additional libraries for malicious activity. Technical analysis revealed the threat actor's capability to deploy Android payloads for second-stage attacks using destructive features. The DoNot APT group's tactics included using Android apps to target victims in the South Asian region, showcasing a novel approach to cyber attacks. The threat actor's use of encrypted strings and obfuscation techniques, along with previous Android malware samples, allowed for attribution to the notorious APT group. The victims targeted by the malware were based in Pakistan, with the threat actor aiming for information gathering for future attacks. This shift in tactics by DoNot APT highlights the group's advancement in deploying Android malware on the Google Play Store, bypassing security checks and leveraging users' trust in the platform. The implications of APTs using this strategy could be significant in the cybersecurity landscape.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as Donot Team, also referred to as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, has been active since at least 2016, targeting government and military entities in South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal. They are known for using Windows and Android malware for espionage purposes, focusing on data collection and exfiltration. The group has shown persistence by consistently targeting the same organizations over the last two years, using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments every two to four months. They have been observed using novel techniques such as remote RTF template injection and exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882. The group's malware framework, yty, consists of various components for data collection, reverse shells, keyloggers, and more, with components written in C++ and Go. The report details two variants of the malware used in recent campaigns, DarkMusical and Gedit, with specific campaigns like Henos targeting military organizations in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The report provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) and MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by the threat actor. The report was published on January 18, 2022, by ESET researchers.





Report 5

The threat actor Donot Team, also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, has been active since 2016 and is believed to be based in India. They have targeted sectors such as embassies, defense, and government agencies in countries like Argentina, Bangladesh, and the UAE. The group has been observed using novel tools like the yty malware framework, which resembles EHDevel, and has engaged in information theft and espionage. They have conducted hacking operations such as spear phishing campaigns against the Government of Pakistan and the deployment of malicious Android apps on the Google Play Store. The group has also targeted prominent activists with spyware and has been linked to attacks on government and military entities in South Asian countries.

Report 6

Summary:
The threat actor known as Donot Team has been identified as leveraging a new modular malware framework called "yty" in South Asia. The framework focuses on file collection, screenshots, and keylogging. The Donot Team is believed to be responsible for creating this new malware framework, with medium confidence that they will target South Asia. The framework shares similarities with the EHDevel malware framework, with a focus on Pakistan. The threat actor uses various evasion techniques, including mixing junk code and anti-sandbox detection. The malware framework includes components such as a downloader, keylogger, screenshot plugin, and system information plugin. The threat actor uses football-themed references to disguise their operations. The Donot Team's TTPs, infrastructure, and malware code are similar to the EHDevel malware, indicating a likely connection between the two groups. The threat actor's use of modular/plugin-based malware frameworks demonstrates their sophistication and continuous improvement in their malicious activities.
