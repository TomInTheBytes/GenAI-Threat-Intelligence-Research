Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor Circles, a surveillance firm affiliated with NSO Group, exploits weaknesses in the global mobile phone system to conduct surveillance on calls, texts, and phone locations worldwide. They sell their products exclusively to nation-states and have been linked to the oft-abused Pegasus spyware. Circles' unique signature associated with Check Point firewalls enabled the identification of their deployments in at least 25 countries. The company operates in secrecy and was founded in 2008, acquired in 2014, and merged with NSO Group. Circles is known for selling systems to exploit SS7 vulnerabilities. The threat actor's motivation is financial gain, and they have targeted victims in various sectors and countries, including Australia, Belgium, Chile, Indonesia, and Nigeria. The threat actor's capabilities and novel techniques pose a significant risk to global telecommunications security.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor, Circles, is a surveillance firm affiliated with NSO Group that exploits weaknesses in the global mobile phone system to conduct surveillance on calls, texts, and phone locations globally. Circles sells its technology exclusively to nation-states and offers systems that connect to local telecommunications infrastructure or use the "Circles Cloud" to interconnect with global telecommunications companies. Evidence of Circles deployments in at least 25 countries was found through Internet scanning, with governments like Australia, Belgium, Mexico, and the UAE likely being customers. Circles' tools operate without leaving obvious traces on targeted devices, making detection difficult. The threat actor's integration with NSO Group and the use of codenames like car brands for clients raise concerns about human rights abuses and surveillance misuse by governments. The threat actor's exploitation of SS7 vulnerabilities poses a significant risk to national security and privacy, with vulnerabilities in U.S. wireless networks highlighted by the Department of Homeland Security. The lack of regulation and oversight in the surveillance industry, coupled with the widespread vulnerabilities in global telecommunications networks, calls for urgent action by governments and telecommunications providers to address these threats. The report provides recommendations for legislators, wireless carriers, and high-risk users to mitigate the risks posed by Circles and similar threat actors. The threat actor's novel techniques and widespread deployments underscore the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect against surveillance abuses.
