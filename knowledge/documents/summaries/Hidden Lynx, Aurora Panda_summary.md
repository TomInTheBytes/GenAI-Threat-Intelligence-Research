Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as Hidden Lynx, also referred to as Aurora Panda, is a highly skilled and organized group with technical prowess and agility. They are known for using the "watering hole" technique to ambush targets, early access to zero-day vulnerabilities, and compromising the supply chain to reach their true targets. The group targets hundreds of organizations in various regions, indicating they may be a professional hacker-for-hire operation. Evidence suggests they have 50 to 100 operatives organized into distinct teams using different tools and techniques. Team Moudoor and Team Naid are two such teams using disposable tools and backdoor Trojans like Moudoor and Naid, respectively. Notable campaigns include the VOHO attack in June 2012, where they compromised Bit9's trusted file signing infrastructure to target US defense contractors. The group's capabilities and novel techniques make them a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape. (Date: Since 2011)





Report 2

The group is associated with other threat actors like APT 17 and Deputy Dog.





Report 3

Hidden Lynx, a threat actor, has been identified as utilizing overlapping infrastructure, tools, and exploits in various campaigns such as VOHO, Aurora, DeputyDog, and Ephemeral Hydra. The threat actor has demonstrated the capability to exploit vulnerabilities shared with other threat actors, indicating a high level of sophistication. The tools used by Hidden Lynx, including Trojan.Naid, Backdoor.Moudoor, and Backdoor.Hikit, have been linked to multiple high-profile operations over the years. The threat actor has targeted a wide range of sectors including technology, finance, energy, defense, government, education, and supply chain. The use of open source intelligence (OSINT) has been crucial in uncovering the connections between different campaigns and threat actors. The analysis conducted on Hidden Lynx reveals a history of recycling effective attack methods while evolving their tactics. The threat actor has been observed to switch delivery methods from spearphishing to watering hole attacks, showcasing adaptability. The use of Recorded Future has enabled the identification of shared vulnerabilities, command and control infrastructure, and tools used by Hidden Lynx across multiple campaigns. The investigation highlights the importance of leveraging web intelligence to understand the intent and capabilities of threat actors.
