Report 1

RedAlpha is a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, possibly linked to PLA and/or Nanjing Qinglan Information Technology Co. Ltd, with a motivation for information theft and espionage. The group has been active since at least 2015 and has targeted government entities, the Tibetan and Uyghur communities, and Falun Gong supporters in regions such as Hong Kong, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, South and Southeast Asia. RedAlpha's campaigns involve light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and the use of diverse malicious tools such as FormerFirstRAT, Gh0st RAT, NetHelp Infostealer, njRAT, and a vulnerability in MS Office. The threat actor has been linked to infrastructure overlaps with other Chinese APTs like APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda, Icefog, Dagger Panda, NetTraveler, APT 21, and Hammer Panda. Recorded Future's Insikt Group has identified two new cyberespionage campaigns by RedAlpha targeting the Tibetan community, with evidence suggesting a high level of capability and sophistication. The threat actor's operations have been reported in 2017 and 2021, showcasing a pattern of multi-year credential theft campaigns against global humanitarian, think tank, and government organizations.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor "RedAlpha" conducted a phishing operation targeting the Tibetan community, ethnic minorities, social movements, a media group, and government agencies in South and Southeast Asia. The operation was simplistic and inexpensive, costing slightly over $1,000 to set up. The threat actor used phishing tactics like impersonating popular email provider logins and malicious OAuth applications for harvesting Google credentials. The operation showed a shift towards phishing tactics from traditional malware threats. The threat actor demonstrated poor operational security and leveraged a bug in a hosting provider to obtain free HTTPS certificates. The operation targeted a wide range of themes beyond the Tibetan community, indicating political interests in China. The report highlights the low adoption rates of security features like two-factor authentication and the need for companies to promote and mainstream such features to mitigate digital espionage threats. The operation spanned from January 2016 to July 2017, with evidence of compromised accounts and monitoring for successful compromises.
