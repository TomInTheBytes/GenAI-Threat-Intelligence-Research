Report 1

Summary:
The Australian airport website of Hobart International Airport was hacked by pro-Islamic State hackers, displaying messages supporting the jihadist group on April 13, 2015. The hackers targeted the web host used by the airport, not the facility itself, and no direct threats were made. This incident highlighted the cybersecurity challenges posed by internet criminal acts. The hackers responsible for the attack, identified as the Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA) or United Cyber Caliphate (UCC), have been known to target organizations worldwide since late 2014. The novelty of this attack lies in the use of defacement to support ISIS, with no reported targeted activities on-site. The airport's operators are reviewing website security with IT service providers, as Australia remains vigilant against radicalized citizens supporting the Islamic State group. The victims targeted were in the aviation sector, specifically an Australian airport website.

Report 3

The Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA) and United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) were responsible for a sophisticated cyber-attack on France's TV5Monde in April 2015. Initially attributed to Islamic State, the attack was later found to be carried out by a group of Russian hackers known as APT 28. The attack used highly targeted malicious software to corrupt and destroy the TV network's systems, with the aim of destruction rather than espionage. The attackers used seven different points of entry, including a company in the Netherlands that supplied equipment to TV5Monde. The attack was a dangerous precedent, showcasing a trend of attacks with physical-world consequences. The financial cost to TV5Monde was significant, with ongoing costs for new protection and changes in employee behavior. The attack was a novel example of state-backed cyber-weaponry testing, indicating an increasingly aggressive posture in the cyber realm.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor identified as the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC), an ISIS-linked hacking group, released a "kill list" of 8,786 US targets for lone wolf attacks. The list included individuals in the US and their addresses, with a specific threat against President Donald Trump. The UCC has been known to release similar lists in the past, targeting members of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues. The group's capability is evidenced by their ability to release such lists and their use of propaganda videos to incite violence. The novelty lies in their use of cyber tools to gather and disseminate sensitive information for potential attacks. The operation time window for this specific release was in April 2017. The victims targeted were from various sectors in the US, including religious institutions.





Report 5

The threat actor identified as the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) has been linked to the publication of a 'kill list' containing the names, email, and physical addresses of over 8,000 individuals globally, including 151 Canadians. The victims targeted are predominantly women from small centers in Canada, with evidence suggesting that most email addresses were obtained through previous social media hacks. The UCC, acting as an umbrella group for pro-ISIS hackers, has a history of defacing websites and releasing multiple 'kill lists' in the past four months. The novelty of their tools and techniques lies in their random selection of victims, unlike previous targeted attacks on specific groups. Law enforcement agencies are actively working to inform individuals on the list, highlighting the disruptive nature of these actions on police investigations. The UCC's goal appears to be to keep people on edge and divert law enforcement resources, showcasing their capability to cause disruption and instill fear. The operation time window for the release of these 'kill lists' spans over the past four months, indicating a sustained effort by the threat actor.





Report 6

The Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA) and United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) threat actors, linked to ISIS, intercepted top secret British Government emails in a major security breach uncovered by GCHQ on September 12, 2015. The threat actors targeted information held by senior British ministers, including Theresa May, the Home Secretary, potentially gaining access to sensitive government and royal family event details. The attack was part of ISIS's broader strategy to target Western entities and create chaos in the Middle East. The threat first emerged in May, prompting security officials to tighten procedures, including password changes. This incident highlights ISIS's evolving cyber capabilities, with hackers recruited to actively target the West. The novelty of the tools and techniques used by the threat actor lies in their ability to breach high-level government systems and potentially compromise national security. The victims targeted were government officials and members of the Royal family, indicating the threat actor's focus on high-profile entities in the region.





Report 7

The Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA) and United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) threat actors, associated with the Islamic State, released personal details of 1,400 mostly US military and government personnel in August 2015. The victims included members of the marine corps, NASA, the State Department, Air Force, and FBI. The threat actors published a spreadsheet online containing names, email addresses, phone numbers, and passwords, urging supporters to attack those listed. The information was claimed to be obtained from military and government databases, although doubts were raised by US army officials and cybersecurity experts. The passwords were noted to be weak and likely aggregated from existing data breaches or publicly available information. The Pentagon was investigating the incident, and Australians, including a member of the Victorian parliament and Australian defense forces, were also targeted. The novelty of this threat actor lies in their ability to gather and release sensitive information of government and military personnel, potentially inciting attacks.





Report 8

The Islamic State Hacking Division, also known as the United Cyber Caliphate, is a merger of hacker groups operating as the digital army for ISIS. The threat actor has targeted U.S. websites, French TV5Monde, Swedish radio stations, and government databases. They have engaged in website defacement, social media hacks, denial-of-service attacks, and releasing 'kill lists.' The group is considered low-threat and inexperienced, using publicly available hacking tools. Investigations suggest external coordination of cyber campaigns under the United Cyber Caliphate name. The threat actor has allegedly linked to Russian intelligence group APT28. The group first emerged in January 2015 and has since conducted multiple attacks, including hacking Australian websites and releasing kill lists. The Islamic State affiliated hacking group has demonstrated the capability to hijack Twitter handles and release large kill lists. The threat actor's tools and techniques are not novel, relying on known hacking methods and publicly available tools.





Report 9

Summary:
The threat actor known as Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA) and United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) posed as Islamic State (IS) supporters to threaten military wives in the United States in February 2015. Evidence suggests that the threat was orchestrated by Russian hackers, specifically the group Fancy Bear or APT28, known for their involvement in the American election interference. The Russian hackers used sophisticated techniques to target military spouses, including sending death threats and hacking social media accounts. The operation aimed to create fear and confusion, with the women initially believing they were targeted by IS sympathizers. The incident highlights the challenge of attributing cyber attacks in a landscape where threat actors often use false flags to mislead investigators. The operation also mirrors the disinformation campaigns conducted by Russian trolls leading up to the 2016 U.S. election. The threat actor's capability to mimic IS threats and manipulate media coverage demonstrates their advanced cyber capabilities and strategic objectives. The incident occurred in the context of heightened tensions surrounding jihadist attacks in France and the broader anti-Muslim sentiment. The operation's success in generating media attention and spreading fear underscores the threat actor's effectiveness in leveraging cyber tools for psychological warfare. The report provides insights into the evolving tactics of threat actors and the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures to counter such sophisticated attacks.
