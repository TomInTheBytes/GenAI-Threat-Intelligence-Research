Report 1

Antlion, a threat actor believed to be involved in espionage activities since at least 2011, has recently been observed targeting organizations in Taiwan in the financial and manufacturing sectors. The group has demonstrated the capability to spend several months on victim networks, allowing for the exfiltration of sensitive information. The tools and techniques used by Antlion, such as CheckID, PsExec, and Living off the Land, show a level of sophistication and novelty. The threat actor's motivation appears to be information theft and espionage, with a sponsor type linked to China. The longevity and persistence of Antlion make it a significant actor to monitor in the cybersecurity landscape. (Report last modified on 2022-02-04)
