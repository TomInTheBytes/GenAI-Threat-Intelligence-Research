Report 1

Summary:
The Alien Labs 2019 Analysis of Threat Groups Molerats and APT-C-37 report focuses on the activities of APT-C-37, also known as Pat-Bear or the Syrian Electronic Army. APT-C-37 targets government agencies, armed forces leadership, media organizations, political activists, and diplomats in Western countries. They utilize popular commercial remote access trojans (RATs) like DroidJack, SpyNote, njRAT, SSLove, and H-Worm. In June 2019, APT-C-37 released an Android app named after WhatsApp to spy on Syrian opposition forces. On the other hand, Molerats, operating since 2012, targets the Middle East and North Africa region, especially Palestinian territories, using phishing campaigns with malicious attachments. They have a lower level of sophistication compared to other groups within the Gaza Hacker Team. Molerats heavily rotate malware and use HTTPS, making them difficult to defend against. The report highlights specific campaigns by both threat groups in 2019, showcasing their novel techniques and tools. The analysis aims to differentiate between the two groups and provide insights into their activities. The report was published on January 15, 2020, by Alien Labs.
