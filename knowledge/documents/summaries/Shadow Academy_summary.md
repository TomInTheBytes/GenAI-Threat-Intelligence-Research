Report 2

Shadow Academy, a threat actor first seen in 2020, has been targeting colleges and universities worldwide, with 20 unique targets identified in Australia, Afghanistan, the UK, and the USA from July to October 2020. The attacks employed tactics similar to those used by the Iranian company Mabna Institute, known for illegally accessing non-Iranian scientific resources. Shadow Academy, as named by RiskIQ, focuses on information theft and espionage in the education sector. The threat actor utilizes domain shadowing to harvest credentials by impersonating university library resources. The tools and techniques used by Shadow Academy show similarities to those of Silent Librarian, but direct attribution to Mabna Institute is not confirmed. The threat actor's operations demonstrate a novel approach to targeting academic institutions for malicious purposes.
