Summary:
The threat actor Lancefly, also known as the Lancefly APT group, has been targeting organizations in South and Southeast Asia with a custom-written backdoor named Merdoor since 2018. The group's activities have been ongoing for several years, with recent campaigns observed in 2020, 2021, and the first quarter of 2023. The motivation behind these campaigns is believed to be intelligence gathering, with a focus on information theft and espionage. The group has targeted sectors such as Aviation, Education, Government, and Telecommunications in South and Southeast Asia. The use of the Merdoor backdoor indicates the advanced capabilities of the threat actor, with novel tools and techniques being employed in their operations. The group's links to previously known groups are of low confidence, leading researchers to classify them under a new group name. The threat actor's country of origin remains unknown.
