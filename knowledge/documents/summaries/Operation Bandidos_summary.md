Summary:
Operation Bandidos, identified by ESET in 2021, targeted corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, with a focus on Venezuela. The malware used, known as Bandook, showed new functionality and changes compared to previous versions. Despite being active since at least 2015, this campaign remained undocumented until now. The threat actor's motivation was information theft and espionage. The victims targeted were primarily in the operating sector of corporate networks in Venezuela. The threat actor's capabilities and the novelty of the tools used indicate a sophisticated and evolving threat. The operation timeframe was not specified in the report.
