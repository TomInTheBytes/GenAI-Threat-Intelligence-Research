Report 1

Rocket Kitten, a threat actor group, has been targeting public and private Israeli/European organizations through two campaigns: a GHOLE malware campaign and "Operation Woolen-GoldFish," possibly state-sponsored. GHOLE malware, active since 2011, is used in targeted attacks by Rocket Kitten. Operation Woolen-GoldFish targets civilian and academic organizations in Israel, German-speaking and European government organizations, and European private companies. The threat actor uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, evolving from GHOLE to a keylogger variant known as CWoolger. The threat actor is possibly politically motivated, with evidence pointing to individuals like "Wool3n.H4T" and "Masoud_pk" as key players. Rocket Kitten's attacks show a progression in capabilities and a focus on entities related to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report provides detailed insights into the tools and techniques used by Rocket Kitten, highlighting their evolving tactics and motivations.

Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as Rocket Kitten, Newscaster, or NewsBeef has been identified targeting victims in various sectors, including a University website in Iran in late February 2016. The threat actor repackaged content from the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) to hook visitors' web browsers, identify visited websites, and explore vulnerabilities. This group, previously known as Charming Kitten, employs social engineering tactics and repurposed open source tools in their operations. They have been observed compromising web applications, delivering backdoors, and using watering hole techniques to track visitors and steal browser history. The threat actor's use of BeEF demonstrates their capability to conduct browser enumeration, social engineering, network exploration, and exploit integration. The novelty of their techniques lies in the repackaging of leaked bot source code and open source components for malicious purposes. The threat actor's activities have been detected globally, targeting entities such as embassies, military schools, and media organizations. The increase in incidents involving BeEF highlights the need for a mix of technologies to combat browser hooking frameworks effectively. The threat actor's persistence and evolving toolset pose challenges for detection and mitigation efforts.
