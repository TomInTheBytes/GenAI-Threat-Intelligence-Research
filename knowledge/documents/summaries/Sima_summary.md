Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as Sima, believed to be based in Iran, has been observed targeting individuals in the Iranian diaspora since at least 2016. The group uses sophisticated spear-phishing tactics, posing as legitimate entities such as Human Rights Watch, to deliver malware-laden documents to victims. This represents an evolution in their social engineering tactics, demonstrating a higher level of English proficiency and investment in background research. The malware binaries used by Sima are designed to appear as legitimate files, using common tactics to conceal their true nature. The group's motivation appears to be information theft and espionage. The tools observed in their operations include Luminosity RAT and Sima. The report does not specify any specific sectors or countries targeted by the threat actor. 

Date of first sighting: 2016
