The threat actor known as PLATINUM is a China-based cybercrime group that has been active since at least 2009, targeting governments and related organizations in South and Southeast Asia. They are highly skilled and have been able to evade detection for many years. PLATINUM utilizes spear-phishing attacks, zero-day exploits, and hot-patching vulnerabilities to target victims, particularly government officials, to steal economically sensitive information. They have been known to exploit web plugins and use malware modules to move through target networks. PLATINUM's novel techniques include abusing the Microsoft Windows hot patching system and exploiting Intel's AMT Serial-over-LAN capabilities for data exfiltration. The group's capability to maintain invisibility and adapt to various protection mechanisms showcases their advanced persistent threat status. The victims targeted by PLATINUM are organizations, companies, and government branches to acquire trade secrets. The group's use of diverse malware families and specialized tools like keyloggers demonstrate their sophistication in cyber operations. The report does not specify a specific date or operation time window for PLATINUM's activities.

Platinum's novel tools and techniques demonstrate their advanced capabilities in cyber espionage.





Report 3

Platinum, a threat actor believed to be related to the PLATINUM APT group, resurfaced in June 2018 targeting diplomatic, government, and military entities in South and Southeast Asian countries. The campaign, named EasternRoppels, utilized a multi-stage approach and employed a previously unseen steganographic technique to conceal communication. The threat actor used WMI subscriptions and PowerShell downloaders to deliver backdoors, with unique encryption keys, C&C IP addresses, and active hours for each loader. The threat actor heavily relied on free hosting services and Dropbox accounts for C&C communication and data exfiltration. The backdoors discovered in the campaign featured text steganography to hide communication with the C&C server. The threat actor also utilized a runtime crypter to protect executable files and deployed a P2P backdoor to connect infected victims into a network. The campaign demonstrated the threat actor's capability to evolve and use novel techniques, indicating ongoing activity and sophistication. The full report is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service.

Report 5

Summary:
The threat actor known as Platinum, one of the most technologically advanced APT actors with a focus on the APAC region, has been identified using a new backdoor named Titanium. The Titanium APT campaign targets victims in South and Southeast Asia, utilizing a complex sequence of dropping, downloading, and installing stages to deploy a Trojan-backdoor as the final step. The threat actor employs various techniques, including shellcode injection, wrapper DLLs, Windows task installers, and BITS downloaders to evade detection. The use of encryption and fileless technologies, along with the mimicking of legitimate software, makes detection challenging. The campaign was last active in 2019, and no current activity has been detected. The report provides detailed insights into the infiltration scheme and capabilities of the Platinum threat actor.
