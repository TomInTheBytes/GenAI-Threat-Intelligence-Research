Report 3

The threat actor known as "DNSpionage" conducted a Global DNS Hijacking Campaign affecting government, telecommunications, and internet infrastructure entities across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and North America. The campaign, linked to actors with a nexus to Iran, targeted victims on an unprecedented scale, utilizing innovative tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involving DNS record manipulation. The threat actor altered DNS A Records, NS Records, and used a DNS Redirector to compromise victims' domains, harvest credentials, and redirect user traffic. The campaign spanned from January 2017 to January 2019, with evidence suggesting Iranian sponsorship based on geolocated IP addresses and alignment with Iranian government interests. The victims included a wide range of organizations, such as telecoms, ISPs, government entities, and sensitive commercial organizations. The attack was difficult to defend against, emphasizing the need for multi-factor authentication, monitoring SSL certificates, and conducting internal investigations to prevent similar attacks in the future. The report provides insights into the evolving tactics of Iran-based threat actors and highlights the need for defensive actions against such DNS hijacking campaigns.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as "DNSpionage" has been conducting widespread DNS hijacking activities targeting multiple sectors, including government, insurance, civilian aviation, ISPs, and infrastructure providers in regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the United States since at least February 2017. The actor's ultimate objective remains unclear, but the hijacking allows them to capture web traffic data for potential follow-on operations. The threat actor used malicious infrastructure and identified 28 organizations in 12 countries whose domains were hijacked. The actor-owned domains were used as name servers for the hijacked infrastructure, with most domains being hijacked for short periods. Notably, internet infrastructure providers were also affected, potentially enabling data collection against a wide range of organizations. The activity could support intelligence collection operations, and there are indications of a possible Iranian nexus, although definitive attribution is currently lacking. The DNS hijacking activity may involve multiple actors due to the extended operation time window and variance in malicious infrastructure.
