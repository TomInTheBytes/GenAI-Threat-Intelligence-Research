Report 2

Salty Spider, also known as Sality malware, has been active since 2003 and continues to pose a threat to organizations today. The malware infects local executables, removable storage, and shared drives, creating a peer-to-peer botnet for downloading and executing other malware. Sality is capable of malicious code injection, modifying its entry point, and implementing rootkit/backdoor capability, keylogging, and worm-like propagation techniques. The malware achieves persistence by modifying the system registry and establishing P2P connections to download additional malware. Sality's longevity and adaptability make it a concerning threat, with capabilities to play a role in various phases of an attack chain. CylancePROTECT is able to detect and prevent Sality before execution, providing protection against this persistent threat. The flexibility and core feature set of Sality allow for a broad spectrum of offensive campaigns, making it a valuable tool for sophisticated attackers to conceal their activity and intentions.
