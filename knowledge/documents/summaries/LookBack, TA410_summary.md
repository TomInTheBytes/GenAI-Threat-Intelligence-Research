Report 3

LookBack, also known as TA410, is a threat actor first seen in 2019 targeting companies in the utilities sector in the USA. They utilized spear phishing emails impersonating a US-based engineering licensing board to deliver malware named "LookBack," which includes a remote access Trojan module and a proxy mechanism for command and control communication. The unique delivery methodology and malware used suggest the involvement of a state-sponsored APT actor. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with observed attacks in the energy and utilities sectors in the USA, Middle East, and Africa. They have been linked to tools like FlowCloud, GUP Proxy Tool, SodomMain, and SodomNormal. The threat actor has been active in hacking operations since 2019, with ongoing campaigns targeting the utilities sector. Their novel techniques and tools highlight the persistent threat posed by sophisticated adversaries to critical infrastructure providers.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor "LookBack, TA410" has been targeting the United States' utilities sector, with evidence of at least 17 entities in the sector being targeted from April 5 through August 29, 2019. The threat actor utilizes phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Word attachments containing macros to install and run LookBack malware. The actor-controlled domain globalenergycertification[.]net was used in the phishing emails, impersonating a licensing body related to the utilities sector. The threat actor demonstrated persistence by conducting reconnaissance scanning against future targets prior to phishing campaigns. The TTPs observed in the campaigns are consistent with previously reported activity, with an update in the macros used in August 2019 campaigns. The threat actor's focus on critical infrastructure providers in the United States remains persistent, despite publications describing their toolset. The LookBack malware utilizes a command and control server at 103.253.41[.]45. The threat actor's evolving TTPs and custom malware indicate an ongoing APT campaign with specific targeting.

Report 5

Summary:
Between July 19 and July 25, 2019, the threat actor LookBack targeted three US companies in the utilities sector with phishing emails impersonating a US-based engineering licensing board. The emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word attachment that installed the LookBack malware, a remote access Trojan (RAT) module with a proxy mechanism for command and control communication. The threat actor utilized unique delivery methodology and malware components, indicating sophistication. The campaign showed overlaps with historical APT campaigns targeting Japanese corporations in 2018, but no definitive attribution to a specific adversary was made. The threat posed a risk to critical infrastructure providers, particularly in the utilities sector. The campaign highlighted the ongoing global risk from nation-state actors and the importance of safeguarding critical infrastructure.





Report 6

Summary:
TA410, a threat actor, targeted the U.S. utilities sector with LookBack and FlowCloud malware campaigns between July and November 2019. The campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents to deliver modular malware to utility providers. Evidence suggests TA410 has RAT capabilities, allowing complete control over compromised systems. The threat actor used shared attachment macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery infrastructure, attributing both LookBack and FlowCloud malware to TA410. Novel techniques included the use of a DropBox URL for payload delivery and a catch statement for alternative malware retrieval. The FlowCloud malware demonstrated a level of complexity and sophistication, with RAT functionalities and multi-stage payload components. The threat actor showed a willingness to evolve phishing tactics and a keen eye for social engineering within the targeted sector. While similarities with TA429 (APT10) were identified, the possibility of intentional false flag activity remains. TA410 has established itself as a motivated actor with mature toolsets targeting critical U.S. energy providers. The report provides indicators of compromise and technical details of the malware's functionality. (Date: June 08, 2020)
