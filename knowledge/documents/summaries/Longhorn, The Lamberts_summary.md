Report 1

Longhorn, a cyberespionage group linked to Vault 7 leaks, has targeted at least 40 victims in 16 countries since 2011, infiltrating various sectors including government, finance, telecoms, and energy. The group's tools closely align with those detailed in the leaked documents, indicating a high level of capability and sophistication. Longhorn's malware, including Corentry and Plexor, exhibits advanced features such as system fingerprinting and exfiltration capabilities. The group's operational security measures, use of unique code words, and customization of malware for specific targets demonstrate a novel approach to espionage operations. Symantec has been tracking Longhorn for three years, providing protection against their tools and tactics to safeguard customer organizations. The evidence suggests that Longhorn is a well-resourced organization with a global reach and state-sponsored characteristics, making it a significant threat actor in the cybersecurity landscape.

Malformed report.





Report 3

Longhorn, also known as The Lamberts, is a subgroup of the CIA that has been active since at least 2011. They have targeted governments and internationally operating organizations, as well as entities in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Their malware is specifically designed for espionage operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. They use a high degree of operational security to avoid detection, communicating externally at select times and using randomization of communication intervals. Longhorn typically configures specific domains and IP addresses per target for their C&C servers, using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications. The threat actor's sponsor is state-sponsored, specifically the CIA, with the motivation of information theft and espionage. The observed attacked sectors include aerospace, aviation, education, energy, financial, government, IT, oil and gas, research, and telecommunications. The observed attacked countries include China, 16 countries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The tools used by Longhorn include various Lambert variants and tools from the Vault 7/8 archives. The report does not mention a specific date or operation time window.





Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Longhorn" or "The Lamberts" was first discovered in 2014 by FireEye and has been compared to other sophisticated threat actors like Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation, and Duqu2. The threat actor has targeted high-profile victims using a variety of sophisticated attack tools, including network-driven backdoors, modular backdoors, harvesting tools, and wipers. The Lamberts toolkit includes multiple generations of malware, with versions for both Windows and OSX, the latest samples being created in 2016. The threat actor's operational security is high, but some mistakes, like a PDB path pointing to a project named "Archan~1," have been observed. The Lamberts toolkit includes families of malware such as Black Lambert, Blue Lambert, Green Lambert, White Lambert, Pink Lambert, and Gray Lambert, each with unique characteristics and capabilities. The threat actor's use of codenames referencing popular culture and the complexity of their attacks make them one of the most sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits analyzed. Kaspersky Lab products successfully detect and eradicate all known malware from the Lamberts family. The timeline of activity for the Lamberts shows that Green Lambert is the oldest, while Gray Lambert is the newest. The threat actor's use of codenames from popular culture, such as Flash Gordon and Spock, adds an unusual element to their operations. The Lamberts toolkit requires a multi-layered defense approach, and Kaspersky recommends effective mitigation strategies to counter these advanced threats.
