Report 1

Summary:
APT35, also known as Charming Kitten, a cyber-espionage group associated with an Iran-based nation state threat actor, was discovered by Darktrace in a pre-infected environment in the EMEA region. The threat actor had infected a corporate device through spear phishing, exhibiting 'low and slow' behavior by remaining undetected and engaging in command and control (C2) beaconing. Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst detected the C2 activity without signatures or threat intelligence, leading to the isolation of the infected device by the internal security team. The threat actor, APT35, was found to be lying low and waiting for further instructions. Darktrace's AI capabilities allowed for the quick identification of the infected device, assessment of the impact of the intrusion, and prevention of further malicious activity. The threat actor's use of known malicious domains and the sophistication of the attack highlighted the need for unsupervised machine learning to detect and defend against evolving threats. The incident demonstrated the value of Darktrace in detecting pre-existing infections and 'low and slow' attacks, showcasing the importance of AI in understanding and responding to cyber threats. The report was published on April 22, 2021.

Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as TA453, also referred to as Charming Kitten, targeted senior medical professionals specializing in genetic, neurology, and oncology research in the United States and Israel in a credential phishing campaign named BadBlood. The campaign, which took place in late 2020, used social engineering lures related to Israeli nuclear capabilities and a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials. TA453 targeted less than 25 senior professionals at medical research organizations in the US and Israel, indicating a shift in their usual targeting. While Proofpoint researchers could not conclusively determine the motivation behind the campaign, it is consistent with TA453's historical alignment with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) collection priorities. The use of novel tactics and techniques, such as the actor-controlled Gmail account and forged Microsoft login page, demonstrates the capability of the threat actor. The campaign signifies a potential evolution in TA453's targeting priorities towards the medical sector, reflecting a broader trend of espionage-focused threat actors targeting medical research globally. The threat actor's historical association with IRGC intelligence collection priorities further supports the attribution to TA453.
