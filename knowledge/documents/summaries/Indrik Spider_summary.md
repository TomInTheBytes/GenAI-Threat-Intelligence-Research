Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor "INDRIK SPIDER" has evolved from operating Dridex banking trojan to deploying BitPaymer ransomware since 2017. INDRIK SPIDER has targeted organizations, including the U.K.'s National Health Service, with high ransom demands. The threat actor has shown sophistication by using anti-analysis features and lateral movement techniques similar to nation-state actors.

Report 16

Summary:
The threat actor "Indrik Spider," also known as Evil Corp, has rebranded their ransomware operation to evade US sanctions by mimicking the PayloadBin gang. The threat actor, previously affiliated with the ZeuS botnet, transitioned to distributing the Dridex banking trojan via phishing emails and later launched the BitPaymer ransomware operation. After being sanctioned in 2019, they renamed their ransomware operations to WastedLocker, Hades, and Phoenix. Recently, they rebranded as PayloadBIN, targeting victims such as the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC. The ransomware appends the .PAYLOADBIN extension to encrypted files and the ransom note is named 'PAYLOADBIN-README.txt.' Security experts confirmed the ransomware is a rebranding of Evil Corp's previous operations, indicating their capability to adapt and evade sanctions. The novelty lies in their impersonation of another cybercrime group, possibly to bypass restrictions on ransom payments. Most ransomware negotiation firms are likely to avoid facilitating payments for victims affected by the PayloadBIN ransomware. Date: June 6, 2021.
