Report 3

Blackgear, a cyberespionage campaign dating back to 2008, has resurfaced targeting organizations in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, particularly public sector agencies and high-technology industries. The threat actor is well-organized, developing its own tools, with recent fine-tuning observed in their latest attacks. Blackgear evades detection by using blogging, microblogging, and social media services for command-and-control communication. The threat actor's tools, Marade and Protux, have encrypted configurations found on public blog and social media posts, indicating a common origin. Protux, an old backdoor, has evolved over the years, with the latest version using the RSA algorithm for encryption. Blackgear's attacks highlight the need for proactive incident response strategies and threat hunting to detect and respond to targeted attacks effectively. Trend Micro's Deep Discovery solution provides defense against such stealthy malware and targeted attacks.
