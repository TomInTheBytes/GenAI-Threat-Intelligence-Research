Malformed report.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor Worok, also known as ESET, has been conducting targeted attacks using undocumented tools against high-profile companies and local governments primarily in Asia since at least 2020. Their toolset includes a C++ loader, a PowerShell backdoor, and a C# loader that uses steganography to extract hidden malicious payloads from PNG files. The activity times and toolset suggest possible ties with TA428, but with low confidence. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with China being identified as the country of origin. Victims targeted operate in sectors such as Energy, Financial, Government, and Telecommunications across various countries in Asia and the Middle East. The novelty of the tools and techniques used by Worok indicate a high level of capability in carrying out sophisticated cyber attacks. (Report last modified on 2022-09-13)
