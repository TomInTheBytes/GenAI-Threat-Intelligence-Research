Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor ITG18, suspected to be an Iranian group, has been linked to various aliases such as Magic Hound, APT 35, and Charming Kitten. They have targeted pharmaceutical companies and U.S. presidential campaigns, with a recent discovery of a server containing over 40 gigabytes of data on their operations. IBM X-Force IRIS analysts uncovered videos showing the operator's activities, providing insight into their methods. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, operating primarily in the defense, government, and pharmaceutical sectors in the USA. The latest reported hacking operations date back to May 2020, showcasing the exfiltration of data from compromised accounts. The novelty lies in the rare opportunity to observe the threat actor's behavior and operations firsthand.





Report 2

ITG18, a sizable Iranian threat group, has been observed making operational security errors while targeting victims aligned with the Iranian reformist movement from August 2020 to May 2021, potentially in support of surveillance objectives leading up to the June 2021 presidential elections in Iran. X-Force discovered a custom Android backdoor named "LittleLooter" used exclusively by ITG18, indicating the group's capability to develop novel tools. LittleLooter allows for extensive surveillance capabilities on infected Android devices, including recording video, call interception, and location tracking. Despite public reporting of their operational security mistakes, ITG18 continues to conduct successful operations, focusing on compromising personal webmail and social media accounts. The threat actor's manual and labor-intensive operations suggest a considerable number of personnel involved, with over 60 servers hosting more than 100 phishing domains observed in 2021. ITG18's persistence in the face of public disclosures and their continued success in operations indicate a group with broad objectives and high confidence in their activities. The threat actor's use of novel tools and techniques, such as LittleLooter, along with their targeting of specific individuals for surveillance purposes, highlights the ongoing threat posed by ITG18.

Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor ITG18, suspected to be an Iranian group overlapping with Charming Kitten and Phosphorus, has been targeting pharmaceutical companies and U.S. presidential campaigns. IBM X-Force IRIS uncovered 40 GB of data on their operations due to operational errors, providing insights into their methods. The threat actor has been active since at least 2013, engaging in credential harvesting and email compromise operations through phishing attacks. They have used a tool called Bandicam for desktop recordings, demonstrating exfiltration of data from compromised accounts. The threat actor targeted military personnel, Iranian-American philanthropists, and U.S. State Department officials. ITG18's objectives align with Iranian strategic interests, with a focus on espionage operations. The threat actor's use of multifactor authentication forces operators to pivot, and they have shown persistence in their operations despite public disclosures. The discovery emphasizes the importance of security hygiene practices such as using MFA and resetting passwords periodically. The report was published on July 16, 2020, by Allison Wikoff and Richard Emerson from IBM X-Force IRIS.
