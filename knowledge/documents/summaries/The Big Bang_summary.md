The threat actor known as The Big Bang has been identified conducting a spear phishing campaign targeting Palestinian law enforcement agencies in Palestine since April 2017. The campaign delivers the MICROPSIA payload to remotely control infected systems. The malware was developed in Delphi and includes references to TV show characters and German language words. The attacker has used genuine documents stolen from Palestinian sources and a controversial music video in the attack. The threat actor has shown similarities to other APT groups such as Molerats, Extreme Jackal, and Gaza Cybergang. The motivation behind the attacks is information theft and espionage. The threat actor has targeted sectors such as law enforcement and others in the Middle East region. The tools and techniques used by The Big Bang are not novel but remain effective. The threat actor's capabilities have been observed to evolve over time, with evident fingerprints in their delivery methods and malware development conventions.
