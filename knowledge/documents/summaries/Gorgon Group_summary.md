Report 3

Gorgon Group, a Pakistan-based threat group, has been active since 2017 and is suspected to be state-sponsored, with a motivation for information theft and espionage. They have targeted government organizations in the UK, Spain, Russia, and the USA, as well as victims in the government and manufacturing sectors. The group has been linked to various malware families such as Agent Tesla, Crimson RAT, and QuasarRAT. Their operations have included phishing campaigns delivering QuasarRAT malware and attacks on governmental organizations globally. Gorgon Group has also targeted the MSME sector in India and the manufacturing and export sectors in India. The group's use of novel tools and techniques, along with their global targeting, demonstrates their advanced capabilities in cyber operations.





Report 4

Summary:
The Gorgon Group, a threat actor group tracked by Unit 42 researchers, has been engaging in targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations since 2017. The group has been linked to Pakistan actors and has been involved in criminal operations as well. Starting in February 2018, the Gorgon Group targeted governmental organizations in the UK, Spain, Russia, and the US, using common URL shortening services for payload downloads. The group's activity includes the use of RATs like NjRat and infostealers like Lokibot. The group's members, including 'fudpages', have been identified to be based in Pakistan. The group's attacks involve phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Word documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199. The group combines both criminal and targeted attack objectives using the same domain infrastructure. Despite the lack of sophistication, the group has been relatively successful in their operations. The group's activity has been detected and protected against by Palo Alto Networks' security solutions. The report provides detailed analysis of the tools, techniques, and infrastructure used by the Gorgon Group in their cyber operations.





Report 5

The Gorgon Group, identified as "Subaat," conducted a targeted phishing campaign against a US-based government organization in mid-July 2017. The attack utilized RTFs exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to deliver the QuasarRAT malware family and a Microsoft Excel file with malicious macros dropping Crimson Downloader. The campaign led to the discovery of a repository of malware hosted on the domain subaat[.]com, which contained a variety of malware families, including LuminosityLink, QuasarRAT, and DarkComet. The threat actor behind the attacks was linked to Pakistan based on IP addresses and domain registration information. The actor, known as 'Subaat,' was active on a hacking forum and interacted with a large number of malicious files on the subaat[.]com server. The evidence suggests a connection to previous campaigns, but conclusive attribution is lacking. The campaign's novelty lies in the use of Crimson Downloader and the extensive repository of malware hosted on the actor's server. (Date: July 16, 2017)
