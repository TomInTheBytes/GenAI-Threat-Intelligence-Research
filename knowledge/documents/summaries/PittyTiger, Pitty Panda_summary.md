Pitty Tiger, also known as Pitty Panda, is a threat actor group originating from China that has been active since at least 2011. They have targeted private companies in sectors such as defense, government, telecommunications, and web development, primarily in Taiwan and Europe. The group's motivation is information theft and espionage, and they have been observed using a variety of tools such as Enfal, Gh0st RAT, Mimikatz, and Poison Ivy.

Pitty Tiger is not believed to be state-sponsored, lacking the experience and financial backing typically associated with such groups. They prefer using custom malware instead of 0day vulnerabilities and have been known to sell their services to potential competitors of their targets in the private sector. The group is relatively small compared to other APT groups, focusing on a limited number of targets.

The threat actor has been linked to operations such as "The Eye of the Tiger" in 2011 and targeted attacks against a French company in 2014. Their malware samples have been discovered as recently as June 2014, with active command and control servers still in operation. Pitty Tiger's novel techniques and tools make them a notable threat actor in the cybersecurity landscape.
