TA2552, a threat actor first seen in 2019 and last modified in 2020, has been identified by Proofpoint researchers for abusing Microsoft Office 365 third-party application access. The actor, using Spanish language lures, prompts users to grant read-only user permissions to their O365 account, seeking access to contacts and mail. This could lead to account reconnaissance, data theft, or interception of password reset messages. TA2552 targets organizations with a global presence, focusing on Spanish-speaking recipients. Their motivation is information theft and espionage. The actor's use of OAuth2 and other token-based authorization methods demonstrates a novel approach to phishing attacks. The threat actor's capability and targeting of specific account resources indicate a sophisticated level of operation.
