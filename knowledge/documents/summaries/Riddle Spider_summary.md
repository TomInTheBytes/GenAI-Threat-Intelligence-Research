The combination of ransomware and DDoS attacks is a concerning trend in the cyber threat landscape. Date: January 24, 2021. Region: Not specified. Operating Sector: Not specified. Type of Company: Not specified.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor "Riddle Spider," known as Avaddon ransomware, recently fixed a flaw that allowed victims to decrypt their files for free. The flaw was discovered by a security researcher who created a decryptor for the ransomware. The ransomware developer quickly fixed the flaw after the decryptor was released. To compensate affiliates affected by the free decryption, the revenue share was increased to 80%. Threat actors closely follow security news and social media, reacting swiftly to vulnerabilities. It is advised not to publicly disclose encryption flaws to prevent threat actors from fixing them. Instead, decryptors should be shared privately with security companies and organizations to assist victims without aiding ransomware developers. The report was published on February 11, 2021, by Lawrence Abrams on BleepingComputer.





Report 3

Summary: Avaddon ransomware, a threat actor, has launched a data leak site to extort victims by publishing stolen data if ransom demands are not met. The threat actor has followed the trend of other cybercrime operations in creating data leak sites to scare victims into paying. Evidence of their capability includes leaking 3.5MB of documents stolen from a construction company on the site. This tactic of using data leak sites is becoming common, turning ransomware attacks into data breaches. Corporate victims are urged to acknowledge the risks and potential costs associated with data breaches. The threat actor's use of data leak sites signifies a shift in ransomware tactics towards data exfiltration and extortion. (Source: BleepingComputer, Date: August 10, 2020)





Report 4

Summary: Avaddon ransomware, utilizing Excel 4.0 macros, has resurfaced in targeted attacks mainly in Italy, with a recent focus on specific victims in the region. The ransomware, distributed through malicious emails containing Excel 4.0 macros, demands a $900 ransom for file decryption. The use of this old technique has proven effective, as evidenced by a significant increase in submissions to the ransomware identification website. Threat actors have adopted this method, along with other campaigns, including COVID-19 themed lures, showcasing the novelty of using Excel 4.0 macros in recent malware campaigns. The resurgence of this technique, despite its age, highlights the ongoing threat posed by Avaddon ransomware and the adaptability of threat actors in utilizing unconventional tools and techniques. (Report date: July 3, 2020)





Report 5

Summary: Avaddon ransomware, operated by the threat actor Riddle Spider, has shut down its operations and released decryption keys for victims. The threat actor targeted victims globally, including companies in critical infrastructure sectors. Evidence of the threat actor's capability is demonstrated by the release of 2,934 decryption keys, each corresponding to a specific victim. The threat actor used novel techniques, such as sharing decryption keys with researchers and releasing a free decryptor tool. The operation shutdown was likely due to increased pressure from law enforcement and governments worldwide. The threat actor's average ransom demand was around $600k, and recent attacks prompted discussions between US President Biden and Russian President Putin. The threat actor's actions indicate a response to heightened scrutiny and law enforcement actions. Date: June 11, 2021.
