Packrat, also known as Citizen Lab, is a threat actor first seen in 2008, with the latest activity observed in 2021. The threat actor has been involved in an extensive malware, phishing, and disinformation campaign targeting Latin American countries such as Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. The targets of Packrat seem to be political opposition, independent press, and high-profile political figures in ALBA countries. The threat actor has shown a systematic interest in these regions, with a focus on information theft and espionage. Packrat has used tools like Adwind, Adzok, CyberGate RAT, and XtremeRAT, showcasing advanced capabilities. The threat actor's activities span across government, media, journalists, and other sectors, indicating a sophisticated and persistent threat. The evidence suggests that Packrat may be sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their lack of concern about discovery and the nature of their targets.
