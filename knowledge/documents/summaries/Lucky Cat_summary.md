Summary:
The threat actor Lucky Cat, also known as Symantec, has been active since at least April 2011, with the last observed attack in February 2012. They have targeted Indian military research and south Asian shipping organizations using simple malware and tailored emails for social engineering. The victims were primarily in India and Malaysia, operating in military research and shipping sectors in the Arabian and South China seas. The attackers focused on information theft and espionage, with evidence of stolen military technologies and source code. They used IP addresses from China and South Korea, possibly through a VPN for anonymity. Lucky Cat's attacks demonstrate a strategic approach with minimal effort for maximum gain, relying on social engineering rather than complex threats. Their tools include Comfoo, Lucky Cat, Sojax, and WMI Ghost. The threat actor's motivation is clear, and their operations have targeted sectors like aerospace, defense, engineering, shipping, and logistics, as well as Tibetan activists in countries like India, Japan, Malaysia, and Tibet.
