Report 1

OnionDog is a threat actor first seen in 2013, primarily targeting the energy, transportation, and infrastructure industries in Korean-language countries. The group's activities are conducted annually, with a focus on information theft and espionage. OnionDog utilizes malware transmitted through vulnerabilities in Hangul office software and USB Worm attacks. They also employ darkweb communication tools to maintain anonymity. The threat actor's operations have been observed in South Korea, with a distinct organizational and objective-oriented approach. The use of novel tools and techniques, such as the USB stick malware and darkweb communication, demonstrate the capability and sophistication of OnionDog. The threat actor's activities have been reported by the Helios Team at 360 SkyEye Labs.





Report 2

Summary:
OnionDog, a threat actor group, was initially thought to be conducting targeted attacks on high-profile targets in the energy and transportation sector of South Korea. However, further investigation revealed that OnionDog was actually part of a cyber drill, not a targeted attack. The threat actor group has been active since 2013, with about 200 unique samples identified. The tools and techniques used by OnionDog, including the use of .onion.city domains for C&C communication, show a level of sophistication and novelty. The malware samples used in the cyber drills mimic real malware behavior, posing risks of exposure and potential misuse by bad actors. The use of real malware in exercises raises concerns about containment and the unintended consequences of public exposure to these tools. The attribution of OnionDog to a specific country or threat actor is challenging due to the nature of the cyber drills and the potential for misinterpretation. The report highlights the importance of understanding the context and purpose of cyber activities before jumping to conclusions.





Report 3

OnionDog, a 3-year-old APT, has been targeting the energy and transportation industries in Korean-language countries. The threat actor uses malware transmitted through vulnerabilities in popular office software and USB worms to infiltrate network-isolated targets. OnionDog also utilizes darkweb communications tools to hide its identity in the Tor network. The threat actor focuses on infrastructure industries, with attacks on harbors, transportation systems, electric power, and water resources corporations. Evidence shows that OnionDog has a strict organizational structure and uses advanced techniques like USB drive ferrying and Onion City for covert communication. The threat actor's activity dates back to October 2013, with a distinct operational window between late July and early September each year. The Helios Team at 360 SkyEye Labs exposed OnionDog's capabilities and highlighted the potential for new attacks in the upcoming summer.
