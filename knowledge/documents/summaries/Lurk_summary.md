Summary:
The threat actor known as Lurk, first seen in 2011 in Russia, targeted financial institutions and media companies. Lurk used a Trojan to steal money from Russian banks by manipulating payment orders through remote banking service software. The malware had a modular structure, with evidence of early development in 2011. The group behind Lurk was motivated by financial crime. In 2016, Russia arrested 50 individuals and shut down a $25 million cyber bank robbery operation linked to Lurk. The threat actor's capability and novel techniques were evident in exploiting security gaps in banking software for financial gain.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Lurk" was involved in a six-year investigation by Kaspersky Lab, culminating in the arrest of alleged members in Russia in early June 2016. Lurk targeted commercial organizations, including banks, stealing nearly three billion rubles using a Trojan that interacted with remote banking service software. The malware had a modular structure and evolved over the years, with a team of specialists behind its development. Lurk's activities included automated theft of money from victim organizations and later expanded to document fraud and SIM card fraud schemes. The group hired professionals similar to those in the Carbanak campaign to enhance their attacks. Despite their careful planning, the group's activities were eventually uncovered, leading to arrests. The investigation highlighted the challenges in translating technical evidence into legal language for prosecution. The case serves as a reminder of the risks posed by cybercriminal groups targeting financial institutions and the importance of implementing strict IT security policies.
