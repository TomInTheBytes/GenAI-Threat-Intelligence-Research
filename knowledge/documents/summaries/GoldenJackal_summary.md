Report 2

Summary:
The GoldenJackal APT group, active since 2019, targets government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. They use a specific toolset of .NET malware, including JackalControl, JackalWorm, JackalSteal, JackalPerInfo, and JackalScreenWatcher for espionage purposes. Infection vectors include fake Skype installers and malicious Word documents. The group's capability is evidenced by their stealthy behavior, use of encryption, and persistence mechanisms. The group's tools are novel, with JackalWorm being a recent addition in 2022. The group's infrastructure includes compromised WordPress websites as C2 servers.

The group's low-profile approach and limited number of high-profile victims suggest a deliberate strategy to avoid detection. The group's toolkit is under development, indicating ongoing investment in their capabilities.
