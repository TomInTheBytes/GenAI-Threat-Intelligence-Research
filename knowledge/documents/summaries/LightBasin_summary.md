Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as UNC1945, tracked by Mandiant, targeted managed service providers and financial/professional consulting industries in a campaign observed from late 2018 to mid-2020. Operating in the Unix environment, UNC1945 utilized tools against Windows and Linux systems, custom virtual machines, and evasion techniques. They demonstrated advanced technical abilities, access to exploits, and a disciplined interest in covering their tracks. UNC1945 exploited a Solaris server using a backdoor named SLAPSTICK and deployed a remote exploitation tool, EVILSUN, with a zero-day exploit. They maintained persistence using tools like LEMONSTICK, LOGBLEACH, and STEELCORGI, and engaged in lateral movement using Mimikatz, PUPYRAT, and IMPACKET. The threat actor's mission remains unclear, with no evidence of data exfiltration observed. The campaign showcased UNC1945's sophistication, persistence, and ability to exploit various operating systems, indicating a continued threat to key industries with inadequate security visibility. The operation involved novel tools and techniques, including the use of virtual machines, zero-day exploits, and anti-forensics measures. The report provides detailed insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by UNC1945, highlighting the threat actor's capabilities and operational sophistication.
