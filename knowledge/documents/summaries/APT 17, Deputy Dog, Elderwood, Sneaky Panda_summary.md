Report 1

APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, conducted a highly sophisticated and targeted cyber attack on Google's corporate infrastructure originating from China on January 12, 2010. The attack resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google and at least twenty other large companies from various sectors, including Internet, finance, technology, media, and chemical industries, were similarly targeted. Evidence suggests that the primary goal of the attackers was to access Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, although only limited information was obtained. Additionally, accounts of human rights advocates in the US, China, and Europe were routinely accessed by third parties, possibly through phishing scams or malware. The attack prompted Google to make infrastructure and security improvements and led to a reevaluation of their business operations in China, potentially resulting in the shutdown of Google.cn. The attack highlights the threat actor's capability to target high-profile organizations and individuals, as well as the use of novel tools and techniques to compromise sensitive information.





Report 2

APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, is run by the Jinan bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Evidence suggests that companies associated with Guo Lin, a likely MSS Officer in Jinan, are linked to APT 17. The threat actor has been identified using tools like ZoxRPC, a hacking tool incorporating code from the Chinese variant of MS08-067. ZoxRPC evolved into ZoxPNG, with Chinese hacker Zhang Peng being credited as the author of the newer variant. APT 17, also known as BLACKCOFFEE, has been used in multiple campaigns by the threat actor. The tools and techniques used by APT 17 show a level of sophistication and evolution over time, with evidence pointing to connections with the Chinese Ministry of State Security. The report was published on July 24, 2019.





Report 3

Threat actor APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, has been active since 2009 and is believed to be state-sponsored by the Jinan bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. They have targeted various sectors including defense, education, energy, financial, government, high-tech, IT, media, mining, NGOs, and lawyers in countries such as Belgium, China, Germany, and the USA. APT 17 is known for using a wide range of tools such as Poison Ivy, PlugX, and several zero-day exploits for Internet Explorer. They have been involved in high-profile hacking operations like Operation Aurora in 2009, targeting organizations like Google, Adobe Systems, and Juniper Networks. The threat actor has also been linked to attacks on Amnesty International websites in 2010 and 2012, as well as the Ccleaner supply-chain attack in 2017. APT 17's sophisticated tactics include leveraging zero-day exploits, spear-phishing emails, and watering hole attacks, indicating a high level of capability and resources. Their association with other threat groups like Hidden Lynx and RedAlpha further highlights their advanced capabilities and connections within the cybercriminal landscape.





Report 4

Summary:
APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, targeted the Amnesty International UK website between 7 and 9 May 2012. The attack aimed to plant the Gh0st RAT Trojan on vulnerable Windows machines through malicious Java code. The Gh0st Trojan has been associated with suspected Chinese hackers in advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, such as the 'Nitro' attacks against energy firms in 2011. Amnesty International UK has been previously targeted in similar attacks in 2009 and 2010. The attack was detected by web security firm Websense, prompting Amnesty to clean up its site. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the use of sophisticated tools and techniques, indicating a high level of expertise. The attack highlights the ongoing threat posed by APT groups targeting organizations in the region.





Report 5

APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, breached security firm Bit9 in July 2012. Evidence suggests that the custom-made malicious software used in the attack was deployed in highly targeted attacks against U.S. Defense contractors. Bit9, a company providing software and network security services to the U.S. government and Fortune 100 firms, was compromised, impacting its core business of distinguishing known safe files from malware. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the targeted nature of the attacks and the use of sophisticated tools. The attack on Bit9 showcases the threat actor's ability to infiltrate high-profile organizations in the defense sector. The operation time window for this breach was in 2012.





Report 6

Summary:
APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, targeted visitors to Amnesty International's Hong Kong website with a Nasty IE 0day exploit in November 2010. The exploit attacked an unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, giving attackers complete control over machines running default versions of IE 6 and 7. The threat actor was able to penetrate deep into the website's security defenses, indicating a high level of capability. The attack code resided directly on the pages of the website, and the attackers sent emails to a select group of people in targeted organizations to infect them with a backdoor trojan. The exploit targeted a vulnerability in IE that handles CSS tags, allowing attackers to execute code by overwriting memory vtable pointers. This incident highlighted the threat actor's use of novel techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in widely used software.

Report 9

Summary:
APT 17, also known as Deputy Dog, Elderwood, and Sneaky Panda, has been linked to the CCleaner supply chain attack by Intezer. The attack showed a strong connection between the Axiom group and the CCleaner hack. The threat actor used unique code shared between the Axiom group and CCBkdr, indicating the same attacker. The attack involved sophisticated techniques such as memory allocation on the heap using LocalAlloc, zlib compression, and modifying legitimate software modules. The malware used steganography to hide IP addresses in HTML fields. The complexity of the attack suggests state-sponsored involvement. The operation was active as of October 26, 2017. The victims targeted were a selective group of x86 Windows users. The tools and techniques used by the threat actor were novel and advanced, indicating a high level of capability.
