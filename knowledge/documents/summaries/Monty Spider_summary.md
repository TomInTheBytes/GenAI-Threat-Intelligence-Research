Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor "Monty Spider" has been identified as the Necurs botnet, which has historically been a major player in cybercrime operations. However, recent evidence suggests that Necurs is losing its elite status and is now distributing clunky scams at high volumes. The botnet's top customers, including banking Trojan gangs, have shifted away from Necurs to collaborate with other groups like Emotet for targeted ransomware attacks. Necurs' operators have resorted to spamming various scams, with millions of emails sent per day in aggressive campaigns. The botnet's capabilities have been overshadowed by Emotet, which offers more targeted infection tactics and capabilities. The threat actor's activity was detected in a January 2020 campaign, with top distributing IPs from Chile, Lithuania, India, and Suriname. The shift in tactics by top banking Trojans away from Necurs indicates a decline in its effectiveness and relevance in the cybercrime arena. The threat actor's future remains uncertain as it faces competition from more advanced and novel techniques used by other cybercrime groups.

Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as Monty Spider, also known as Gold Riverview, is associated with the Necurs botnet, which emerged in 2012 and has evolved to partner with elite cybercrime gangs for spamming and infection activities. Operating globally, Necurs has been observed distributing various malware, including Dridex, Locky, and TrickBot. The threat actor's primary motivation is financial gain, with reported hacking operations dating back to 2016, including involvement in stock market manipulation and cryptocurrency scams. Necurs has demonstrated technical complexity and adaptability, using novel techniques such as DNS TXT records for redirection and taking screenshots of infected devices. In 2020, Microsoft and partners conducted a coordinated operation to disrupt the Necurs botnet, which had infected over nine million computers worldwide.





Report 4

Monty Spider, a threat actor, has been identified as the creator of the Necurs.P2P hybrid peer-to-peer botnet. The botnet was discovered to be active in February 2016. The installation process involves anti-virtualization code that causes a BSOD in virtual environments. The bot elevates itself using CVE-2010-4398 and whitelists its processes in the firewall after reboot. The botnet utilizes a hybrid P2P structure, allowing commands to be sent from centralized C&C servers while maintaining the resilience of a peer-to-peer network. P2P communication involves a random port number generated and stored in the registry, with over 1000 IP and port combinations contacted for replies. The P2P payloads are signed by the botmaster's 2048-bit RSA key and can contain DNS, C&C, and update blocks. The botmasters distribute peer lists via the C&C server to prevent poisoning attacks. The botnet's unique capabilities and novel techniques demonstrate Monty Spider's advanced threat actor capabilities.





Report 5

Summary: The threat actor "Monty Spider" has been identified as utilizing the Necurs malware strain, which has recently been updated to include new features such as taking screenshots of infected users' screens and reporting runtime errors. The Necurs malware is distributed via spam emails and is known for its downloader capabilities, which allow it to gain persistence, collect telemetry, and download and install additional payloads. The addition of a Powershell script for screen capture and an error reporting function are novel features not typically seen in downloaders. Symantec suggests that the threat actor behind Necurs may be targeting valuable hosts, such as those in professional office environments, and is currently spreading Locky ransomware and TrickBot banking trojan. The report was published on October 17, 2017.





Report 6

Summary:
The threat actor "Monty Spider" has been identified as the Necurs botnet, which is using a new evasion technique involving internet query files (IQY) to distribute malware. The IQY files are being used as an initial infection vector to execute PowerShell scripts and download trojanized remote access applications. The malware, identified as BKDR_FlawedAMMYY, is a backdoor developed from leaked source code of Ammyy Admin. This new technique poses a challenge as it disguises malicious activity within normal web queries, making detection difficult. The threat actor has been active in various cyberattacks, including distributing Locky ransomware in 2017. Enterprises are advised to employ strict security protocols and solutions like Trend Micro's endpoint security to defend against evolving threats like Necurs. The report provides indicators of compromise (SHA-256s) for detection and mitigation purposes. The report was published by Trend Micro on their blog on an unspecified date.





Report 7

The threat actor known as "Monty Spider" has been linked to the distribution of Locky ransomware, which has been decreasing in activity since March 2017. Locky ransomware, initially spread through the Necurs botnet, was a prevalent strain on the internet, but its activity has significantly declined. Evidence suggests that Necurs, previously a key distributor of Locky, has shifted focus to other malicious activities, indicating a change in operations. The decrease in Locky spam campaigns and the absence of new variants since December 2017 point to a potential temporary halt in Locky's operations. Researchers have noted the decline in Locky activity and the rise of other ransomware threats like Cerber and Spora. The connection between Locky and Necurs suggests a coordinated effort, but the current lack of Locky activity raises questions about the future of the ransomware. The threat actor's capabilities and tools have shown a shift away from Locky, indicating a potential change in tactics or targets.





Report 8

Summary:
The threat actor "Monty Spider" is associated with the Necurs botnet, which has been observed engaging in a pump&dump spam scheme to artificially boost stock market prices, specifically targeting InCapta Inc (INCT) in the media sector. The spam campaign involved sending multiple waves of messages to manipulate stock prices, resulting in a significant increase in share value. The Necurs botnet, with a monthly population of 5 to 6 million unique bots, demonstrated its capability to send tens of thousands of messages per hour. This activity, which took place on March 20 and 21, 2017, marked Necurs' return to pump&dump schemes after a period of dormancy following previous ransomware distribution campaigns. The use of spam to manipulate stock prices is a known tactic dating back to the 90s, but the novelty lies in the scale and effectiveness of the Necurs botnet in carrying out such schemes. The threat actor's ability to influence financial markets through spam campaigns underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats in the financial sector.

Report 11

Summary:
The threat actor "Monty Spider" has been identified as the operator of the world's largest spam botnet, Necurs. The botnet has recently updated its techniques to avoid detection by sending emails with archive files that unzip to .URL shortcut files, leading to the download and execution of a final payload. This new technique is a departure from Necurs' usual complex infection chains, making it harder for email malware scanners to detect. The simplicity of the method allows for easier victim infection. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the ability to adapt and evade detection mechanisms. The victims targeted by this spam campaign are not specified in the report. The report was published on April 27, 2018.





Report 12

Summary: The threat actor "Monty Spider" is associated with the world's largest spam botnet, Necurs, which has been engaging in pump-and-dump spam campaigns for years. Recently, Necurs started promoting an obscure cryptocurrency named Swisscoin, marking the first time it has promoted a cryptocurrency instead of penny stocks. Evidence suggests that Necurs has millions of bots and has been known for spreading malware like the Dridex banking trojan and ransomware. The spam campaigns promoting Swisscoin resulted in a 40% price drop for the cryptocurrency. The novelty lies in Necurs' shift towards promoting cryptocurrencies and the use of pump-and-dump techniques. The operation time window for Necurs typically includes an annual holiday break between early December and mid-January. The threat actor's capability is demonstrated through the large-scale spam campaigns and manipulation of cryptocurrency prices.
