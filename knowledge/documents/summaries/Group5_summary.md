Group5, a state-sponsored threat actor originating from Iran, has been targeting the Syrian opposition since at least 2015. The group utilizes Iranian-language tools, Iranian hosting companies, and operates from the Iranian IP space. They have been observed using sophisticated malware operations, including malicious PowerPoint files and Android malware, to target well-connected individuals in the Syrian opposition. Group5's tactics are novel in that they follow in the footsteps of other regime-linked malware groups targeting the same victims. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage. The tools used by Group5 include DroidJack, NanoCore RAT, and njRAT. The activity of Group5 demonstrates a high level of capability and sophistication in their cyber operations.
