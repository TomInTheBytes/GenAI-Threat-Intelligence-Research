Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Dust Storm, also referred to as Cylance, has been active since 2010, with a notable increase in attacks starting in June 2011. They have targeted victims in the energy, oil and gas sectors, as well as Uyghurs, operating in Japan, South Korea, USA, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Dust Storm has shown capability in using public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants, as well as exploiting vulnerabilities such as CVE-2011-1255 and CVE-2010-1885. The group is believed to be state-sponsored, with a motivation for information theft and espionage. The tools and techniques used by Dust Storm, including Gh0st RAT, Misdat, MiS-Type, Poison Ivy, and S-Type, demonstrate a level of sophistication and novelty in their operations. The threat actor's activities have been ongoing, with evidence of manual network and host enumeration shortly after compromise.
