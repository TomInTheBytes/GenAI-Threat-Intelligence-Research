Report 1

Cadelle, an Iran-based threat actor, has been conducting targeted surveillance on domestic and international targets, including airlines and telecom providers in the Middle East region. The threat actor consists of two groups, Cadelle and Chafer, with shared interests in targets. Cadelle uses Backdoor.Cadelspy, while Chafer uses Backdoor.Remexi and Backdoor.Remexi.B. The groups' attacks have been ongoing since at least 2011, with evidence of custom-made back door threats. Cadelle infects targets with Backdoor.Cadelspy, while Chafer compromises web servers to drop Backdoor.Remexi. The threat actor primarily targets individuals in Iran, with victims including dissidents, activists, and researchers. The victims also include organizations in the Middle East region, such as airlines and telecom companies. Cadelle and Chafer's activities suggest a focus on tracking individuals' movements and communications. The threat actor's operational hours align with Iran's time zone, indicating a possible Iranian origin. The malware used by Cadelle and Chafer allows for keystroke logging, data theft, audio recording, and remote access. Mitigation strategies include regular software updates and security software maintenance. Symantec security products provide protection against the threats. The threat actor remains active, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity measures.
