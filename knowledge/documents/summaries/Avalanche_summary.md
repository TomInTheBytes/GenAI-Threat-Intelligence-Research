Report 2

Avalanche, a threat actor first seen in 2006, has been utilizing a botnet infrastructure to distribute malware variants to victims, including major financial institutions, with a focus on financial gain. The group has been observed using fast-flux DNS to hide their criminal servers and has been linked to distributing GozNym and other malware. The victims targeted operate in various sectors worldwide, with sensitive personal information being stolen, and compromised systems being used for malicious activities like DoS attacks. Avalanche has also been involved in money mule schemes, recruiting individuals for fraudulent activities. The threat actor's operations have been reported as early as 2010, with counter operations leading to the dismantling of the 'Avalanche' network in 2016. The group's country of origin is Russia.





Report 3

The threat actor known as Avalanche was a criminal syndicate involved in phishing attacks, online bank fraud, and ransomware. Operating mainly in Eastern Europe, Avalanche targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. They used spam emails to deceive victims into entering personal information on fake websites, installed malware to steal data, and conducted man-in-the-middle attacks on banking platforms. Avalanche was responsible for a significant portion of phishing attacks in 2009, with a high level of sophistication and volume. The group used fast-flux DNS and hosted domains on compromised computers, making it challenging to take down their infrastructure. In November 2016, an international consortium of law enforcement agencies, private organizations, and academic institutions successfully destroyed the Avalanche botnet after a four-year project. The takedown involved seizing servers, freeing zombie computers, and arresting the individuals behind the botnet. Avalanche was described as one of the most sophisticated and damaging phishing groups on the internet, with a wide range of malware families associated with their activities. The operation to dismantle Avalanche was considered one of the largest sinkholing operations in history, involving the analysis of massive amounts of data and collaboration between multiple organizations.
