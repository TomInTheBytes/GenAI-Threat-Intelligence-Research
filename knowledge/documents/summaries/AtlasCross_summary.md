Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor "AtlasCross" was discovered by NSFOCUS Security Labs, operating in North America and targeting specific hosts within a network domain. The attacker utilized phishing documents related to the Red Cross Blood Drive to initiate cyberattacks. The attack process involved three phases: decoy document, loader, and Trojan horse. The attacker demonstrated high technical capabilities and cautious attack strategies, using novel techniques such as process injection, reflective loading, API confusion, and anti-virtualization measures. The Trojan programs named DangerAds and AtlasAgent were identified, showcasing advanced capabilities in obtaining system information, executing shellcode, and communicating with CnC servers. The attacker's persistence, defensive evasion tactics, and command control mechanisms indicate a sophisticated and targeted threat actor. NSFOCUS Security Labs will continue monitoring AtlasCross for future cyberattack activities. (Date: September 25, 2023)
