Report 1

The threat actor known as Operation Hangover has been targeting Pakistan, China, the U.S., and other nations for three or more years, focusing on national-interest and industrial entities, including organizations in Pakistan, the U.S., Norway, Iran, China, and other countries. The threat actor employs a franchise-style approach, hiring out different aspects of the campaign, and has been found dropping Mac OS X malware in its attacks. The attackers have been trying to hide their tracks online and have been observed removing resumes and other information from the web after being exposed. The threat actor uses a commercialized model with freelance code-writers and a standardized approach to establishing domains. The use of Mac malware and the organization of the actors involved in the campaign are novel aspects of this threat actor. The involvement of the Indian security firm Appin Security Group is under scrutiny, with evidence suggesting a potential connection to the cyberattacks. The threat actor targets various industries, including military, government, mining, telecommunications, law firms, food, restaurants, and manufacturing. The report was published on July 18, 2013, and researchers are set to provide more details on the new Mac malware found in the attacks.

Report 3

The threat actor, known as Operation HangOver, Monsoon, and Viceroy Tiger, has been active since 2010, with a peak in 2012, targeting sectors such as Defense, Government, Hospitality, and Telecommunications in countries like Austria, Canada, India, and the USA. The group's attacks involve spear phishing emails to high-level management for information theft and espionage purposes. The tools used by the threat actor include AutoIt backdoor, BackConfig, BADNEWS, TINYTYPHON, Unknown Logger, and WSCSPL. The group's operations have been linked to the Indian security company Appin Security Group. The threat actor's capabilities and extensive infrastructure for targeted attacks indicate a high level of sophistication and persistence. The most recent reported hacking operation was in 2020, targeting Government and Military Organizations in South Asia with updated BackConfig malware.





Report 4

The threat actor known as the Hangover Group, also referred to as Neon, Viceroy Tiger, and MONSOON, has been targeting government and military organizations in South Asia since December 2013. They deploy BackConfig malware through spear-phishing campaigns using local and topical news lures to trick victims into downloading weaponized Microsoft Office documents. Once executed, the malware establishes backdoor communication with the threat actors, allowing for espionage activities and potential data exfiltration. The Hangover Group has been observed using compromised third-party infrastructure to deliver their weaponized documents, evolving from plain text to encoded URLs and executables. They employ multiple stages and components during installation to evade detection, including Virtualization-based Security, batch codes, scheduled tasks, and conditional trigger files. The BackConfig malware communicates with the threat actors over HTTPS, making detection more challenging. The threat actor's objectives vary based on the plugins deployed and the compromised system or organization. The Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention platform with WildFire, DNS Security, and Cortex XDR can detect and mitigate activity associated with this threat group. Date: June 3, 2020.





Report 5

Summary:
The threat actor known as Hangover, also referred to as Neon, Viceroy Tiger, and MONSOON, has been observed targeting government and military organizations in South Asia over the last four months. They use spear-phishing attacks with local and topical lures to deliver the BackConfig malware, a custom trojan with a flexible plug-in architecture. The malware is delivered through weaponized Microsoft Excel documents via compromised legitimate websites. The threat actor's capability includes gathering system and keylog information, uploading and executing additional payloads, and evading sandbox and dynamic analysis systems. The threat actor has evolved their delivery methods, including the use of BITS and ZIP files, and fine-tuning their execution flow to evade detection. The threat actor's infrastructure, digital signatures, and indicators of compromise have been documented. The threat actor's focus on evading detection and rapidly deploying campaigns indicates a high level of sophistication and persistence. The report provides detailed technical information and protections against this threat actor.
