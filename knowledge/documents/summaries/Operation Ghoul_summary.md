Report 1

Operation Ghoul, also known as OpGhoul, is a threat actor group first seen in 2016 and observed to be highly active in the Middle East region. They have been conducting targeted attacks through spear phishing emails containing compressed executables to collect data such as passwords, keystrokes, and screenshots. The group mainly targets industrial, engineering, and manufacturing organizations in over 30 countries, with a focus on SMBs. The attackers' motivations appear to be financial, involving information theft and espionage. The use of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes attribution of the attacks more challenging. The tools and techniques used by Operation Ghoul are novel and have been ongoing since at least March 2015. The victims operate in sectors such as education, IT, pharmaceutical, shipping, and tourism, spanning countries like the USA, China, Iran, and the UK.





Report 2

Summary:
Operation Ghoul, a targeted attack on industrial and engineering organizations, was observed by Kaspersky Lab starting on June 8th and 27th, 2016, with a focus on the Middle East region. The attackers used spear phishing emails with compressed executables to target over 130 organizations in more than 30 countries, mainly SMBs in the industrial sector. The attackers' motivations were financial, aiming to steal banking information or intellectual property. The malware used in the attacks was based on the Hawkeye commercial spyware, collecting data such as passwords, keystrokes, and screenshots. The malware connected to a command center to exfiltrate data, and phishing pages were used to target victims. The attacks were highly active in the Middle East, with a significant number of detections reported. The malware files had specific heuristic signatures for detection. Kaspersky Lab recommended caution in handling emails and attachments to prevent data leakage and financial loss. The report provided indicators of compromise for identifying potential infections.
