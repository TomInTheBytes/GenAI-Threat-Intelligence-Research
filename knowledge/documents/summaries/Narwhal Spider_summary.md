Report 2

Cutwail spam botnet, operated by Narwhal Spider threat actor, shifted from using Blackhole exploit kit to Magnitude exploit kit after the arrest of Blackhole's developer in October 18, 2013. The Cutwail botnet historically distributed Gameover Zeus trojan through themed spam campaigns, now distributing it via Magnitude exploit kit. The spam emails contain a fake "update your browser" website to trick users into downloading Gameover Zeus while redirecting to Magnitude exploit kit. Magnitude exploit kit installs ZeroAccess trojan on vulnerable systems using known CVEs. The threat actor quickly adapted their tactics to maximize infection rates, combining social engineering with exploit kits. Customers are advised to restrict access to domains associated with the threat actor. The threat actor's capability to rapidly adjust operations and utilize novel techniques poses a significant risk to victims in various regions and sectors.
