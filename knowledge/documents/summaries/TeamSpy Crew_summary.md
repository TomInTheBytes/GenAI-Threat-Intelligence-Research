Report 2

The threat actor known as TeamSpy Crew, also referred to as SIG39, Iron Lyric, Team Bear, and Anger Bear, has been active since at least 2010, with evidence suggesting a long-term cyber-espionage campaign targeting heavy industry, government intelligence agencies, and political activists. The attackers utilize a combination of legitimate software packages and commodity malware tools, with a particular affinity for using the TeamViewer application. The attackers have been observed targeting victims in sectors such as education, government, industrial, electronics, and high-profile individuals across numerous countries, including Russia.

The TeamSpy Crew's motivation appears to be information theft and espionage, with reported hacking operations dating back to at least 2017 involving the distribution of the TeamSpy data-stealing malware through spam campaigns. The threat actor's use of tools such as TeamSpy, TeamViewer, and JAVA RATs indicates a sophisticated and persistent approach to their operations. The extensive list of targeted countries and sectors, as well as the longevity of the campaign, demonstrate the threat actor's capability and persistence in conducting cyber-espionage activities.
