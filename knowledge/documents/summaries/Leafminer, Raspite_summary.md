Report 2

Leafminer, also known as Raspite, is a threat actor group that has been active since at least early 2017, targeting government organizations and businesses in the Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. They use publicly available techniques and tools, including proof-of-concept exploits, to infiltrate target networks through methods such as watering hole websites and brute-force login attempts. Their post-compromise toolkit indicates a focus on stealing email data, files, and database servers. Raspite, specifically, targets electric utility organizations in the US using strategic website compromise to gain access and harvest Windows credentials. The group then deploys malicious services to remotely access victim machines. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with Iran being identified as the country of origin. Victims operate in sectors such as energy, financial, government, and transportation in countries like Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, USA, Europe, and East Asia. Tools used by the threat actor include Imecab, LaZagne, Mimikatz, PhpSpy, and Sorgu. The report does not mention specific hacking or counter operations against the threat actor.





Report 3

Summary:

The threat actor known as RASPITE, identified by Dragos since 2017, targets access operations in the electric utility sector, focusing on entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. They use strategic website compromise to gain initial access and deploy malicious scripts for remote access. RASPITE overlaps with Symantec's LEAFMINER and has not demonstrated ICS-specific capabilities for destructive attacks. While their current focus is on initial access operations, their methodology indicates potential for future ICS events. Dragos provides threat intelligence on RASPITE through their platform and does not conduct political attribution. Full details on RASPITE are available to network defenders via Dragos WorldView.
