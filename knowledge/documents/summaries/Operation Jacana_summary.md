Malformed report.





Report 2

Summary:
Operation Jacana, attributed to a China-aligned threat group, was first seen in February 2023 targeting a governmental entity in Guyana. The threat actors used a previously undocumented C++ backdoor named DinodasRAT for file exfiltration, registry manipulation, and CMD command execution. The motivation behind the attacks was information theft and espionage. The observed attacked sector was governmental, and the observed tools used included DinodasRAT, Impacket, PlugX, and SoftEther VPN. The threat actor's novel use of DinodasRAT and targeting of a specific governmental entity in Guyana demonstrate their advanced capabilities and tactics. The operation was reported by ESET researchers in October 2023.
