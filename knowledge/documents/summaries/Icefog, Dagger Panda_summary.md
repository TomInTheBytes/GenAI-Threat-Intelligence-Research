The group has been active in targeting organizations in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the technology and government sectors. The capability of the threat actor is evidenced by their use of sophisticated tools and techniques, including the reemergence of old malware strains. The attacks have been ongoing, with the threat actor showing a high level of persistence and adaptability. The novelty of using old malware in new attacks showcases the group's ability to evade detection and continue their malicious activities. The report does not specify a specific date or operation time window for these recent attacks.





Report 2

Icefog, also known as Dagger Panda, is an Advanced Persistent Threat group that has been active since at least 2011, with a focus on targeting Japan and South Korea. The threat actor has targeted governmental institutions, military contractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom operators, industrial and high-tech companies, and mass media. Icefog has been linked to state-sponsored information theft and espionage activities, with observed attacks in sectors such as Aerospace, Defense, Government, High-Tech, Maritime and Shipbuilding, Media, Telecommunications, and Utilities. The threat actor has used tools like Dropper, Dagger Three, Icefog, Javafog, ShadowPad, and Winnti, with novel techniques such as the "Javafog" backdoor observed in 2014. Icefog has conducted hacking operations like the "TOPNEWS," "APPER," "WATERFIGHT," "PHKIGHT," and "SKYLINE" campaigns, targeting various organizations in different countries. The threat actor has shown the capability to shut down command-and-control servers and adapt its tactics over time.





Report 3

In 2013, the threat actor Icefog, also known as Dagger Panda, targeted government organizations and defense industries in South Korea and Japan. Despite a decrease in sample numbers, the attacks using Icefog malware continued. Recent attacks showed a new variant of Icefog samples with evolved tactics, techniques, and procedures compared to the 2013 campaign. The threat actor applied different methods to evade detection in the new campaign. The Icefog operator potentially has connections with other APT groups. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the use of novel tools and techniques, including file-less payloads and customized loaders. The campaign timeline spans from 2013 to 2019, targeting various sectors and regions, including agriculture companies in Europe, media, finance, and government organizations in Mongolia and Russia, and water source providers, banks, and governments in Turkey, India, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The threat actor's infrastructure and malware samples indicate potential connections to APT15, Roaming Tiger, and APT9. The threat actor's activities suggest ongoing and future attacks leveraging Icefog malware.





Report 4

Icefog, also known as "Dagger Panda," targeted government institutions, military contractors, maritime, and ship-building groups in South Korea and Japan. The threat actor shut down all known command-and-control servers but continued monitoring operations, leading to the discovery of a Java version of Icefog referred to as "Javafog." The Icefog operation has been active since at least 2011, with various generations of malware targeting Microsoft Windows PCs and a native Mac OS X implementation called "Macfog." The threat actor used novel techniques, such as a Java backdoor named Javafog, which was observed connecting to the domain "lingdona[dot]com." The Javafog backdoor allowed the threat actor to control infected systems, upload files, and execute commands. Victims of Javafog were primarily located in the United States, including a large American independent Oil and Gas corporation. The discovery of Javafog indicates a new generation of backdoors used by the Icefog threat actor, suggesting a shift towards more stealthy and long-term operations targeting US entities. The report was published on January 14, 2014, by Kaspersky researchers Vitaly Kamluk, Igor Kuznetsov, and Costin Raiu.
