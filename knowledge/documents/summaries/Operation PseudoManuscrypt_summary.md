Report 1

Summary:
Operation PseudoManuscrypt, attributed to a threat actor possibly linked to China, was first seen in 2021 and identified by Kaspersky experts. The malware, with similarities to Lazarus Group's Manuscrypt, uses a unique data exfiltration channel utilizing the KCP protocol associated with APT 41. The malware is distributed through pirated software installers, with over 35,000 computers in 195 countries being targeted. Victims include industrial and government organizations in sectors such as construction, defense, energy, and manufacturing. The threat actor's motivation appears to be information theft and espionage. The novelty of the tools and techniques used by the threat actor, as well as the wide range of targeted victims, distinguish this operation from typical APT attacks.
