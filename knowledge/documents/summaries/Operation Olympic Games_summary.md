Report 1

Summary:
- Threat actor: United States and Israel
- Region: Iran
- Operating sector: Nuclear enrichment facilities
- Type of company: Government
- Date: Operation started in the Bush administration and continued into the Obama administration
- Evidence of capability: Developed sophisticated cyberweapons, including the Stuxnet worm, to target Iran's nuclear program
- Novelty of tools and techniques: First sustained use of cyberweapons to physically destroy infrastructure, achieved through the use of the Stuxnet worm
- Collaboration with Israel for technical expertise and intelligence
- Obama administration authorized and oversaw the cyberattacks, despite risks and potential exposure of the code
- Impact: Set back Iran's nuclear program by 18 months to two years, but Iran's enrichment levels have since recovered

Overall, the threat actor, consisting of the United States and Israel, demonstrated advanced capabilities in cyberwarfare by developing and using the Stuxnet worm to target Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, marking a significant shift in the use of cyberweapons to achieve physical destruction.





Report 2

Summary:

The threat actor known as Operation Olympic Games, also referred to as GOSSIPGIRL, was first seen in 2007 and has been linked to state-sponsored entities such as the Equation Group (NSA), CIA, and Unit 8200 from the USA and Israel. The threat actor's primary motivation includes information theft, espionage, sabotage, and destruction. The victims targeted by Operation Olympic Games were primarily in the energy sector, with Iran being the observed country of operation. The threat actor's most notable tool is the Stuxnet malware, which was used in sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. The operation was documented in various sources, including a 2015 book and a 2016 documentary, with additional details revealed in a 2019 investigative report. The capability and novelty of the tools and techniques used by Operation Olympic Games demonstrate a high level of sophistication in cyber warfare. The operation was ongoing until at least 2010, with evidence of continued attacks and counter operations against the threat actor.





Report 3

The threat actor, identified in the report "Operation Olympic Games," targeted the Iranian nuclear complex in Natanz in 2007, resulting in the sabotage of the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The operation involved the installation of equipment by a Dutch AIVD agent, Erik van Sabben, who was recruited by the Dutch intelligence service. The operation, conducted in collaboration with the American CIA and Israeli Mossad, led to the destruction of nearly a thousand ultracentrifuges, causing significant delays in the Iranian nuclear program. The novel aspect of this threat actor's capability was the use of the Stuxnet virus, a sophisticated digital weapon, to carry out the sabotage covertly. The operation raised questions about political oversight and the geopolitical implications of engaging in cyber warfare. The involvement of a Dutch engineer in the operation highlighted the international collaboration and the use of unconventional tools and techniques in cyber operations. The report does not provide specific dates for the operation but mentions events spanning from 2007 to 2010.
