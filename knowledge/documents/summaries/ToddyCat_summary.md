Report 4

Summary:
ToddyCat is an unknown APT actor targeting high-profile entities in Europe and Asia since December 2020. They use sophisticated tools like the 'Samurai backdoor' and 'Ninja Trojan'. The group started by compromising Exchange servers in Taiwan and Vietnam, then escalated attacks across Europe and Asia using the ProxyLogon vulnerability. The Samurai backdoor allows arbitrary code execution and lateral movement within networks. The Ninja Trojan is a collaborative tool for multiple operators to control remote systems. ToddyCat's activities have continued intensively, especially in Asia, with various loaders and installers. The threat actor targets government, military, and military contractors, with victims in multiple countries. Despite similarities with Chinese-speaking APT groups, ToddyCat remains unattributed.
