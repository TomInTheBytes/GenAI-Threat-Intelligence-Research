Malformed report





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor Grayling, a previously unknown APT group, targeted organizations in manufacturing, IT, and biomedical sectors in Taiwan, as well as a government agency in the Pacific Islands, and organizations in Vietnam and the U.S. The campaign started in February 2023 and lasted until at least May 2023. Grayling used custom malware and publicly available tools, including a distinctive DLL sideloading technique with a custom decryptor to deploy payloads. The motivation behind the attacks appears to be intelligence gathering for information theft and espionage. The group's novel techniques and tools included Cobalt Strike, Havoc, Mimikatz, and NetSpy. The report was first seen in 2023 and last modified on October 13, 2023.
