The group utilizes a combination of custom malware and publicly available tools such as Cobalt Strike, Graphon, and Metasploit. The victims targeted operate in sectors including telecommunications, government, and IT. The sophistication of the tools used and the specific targeting of certain sectors indicate a high level of capability. The most recent activity was observed in October 2021. The motivation behind the attacks is information theft and espionage. The threat actor's origin is unknown, but the evidence suggests state sponsorship.
