Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Nazar, also referred to as Epic Turla, SIG37, and Iron Tiger, has been active since at least 2008 with potential development continuing until 2013. The operation displays variable developmental capability, utilizing both common resources and novel COM techniques in DLL drops. The operation has been noted by the NSA but has not received specific coverage from the security industry, possibly due to being encountered on Iranian systems overlapping with EQGRP implants. The motivation behind Nazar's activities is information theft and espionage, with observed tools including Distribute.exe, EYService, GpUpdates.exe, and Microolap Packet Sniffer. The threat actor operates from Iran and targets victims in various sectors and countries. The report does not mention specific dates or operation time windows.
