The attack showcases the threat actor's capability to target high-profile companies in the medical technology sector using novel ransomware tools and techniques.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as BlackMatter ransomware has shut down, leading existing affiliates to move victims to the LockBit ransomware site for continued extortion. Affiliates are transferring victims to LockBit's negotiation site, where ransom payments are negotiated. BlackMatter is in the process of deleting their presence from Russian-speaking hacking forums. LockBit has emerged as a successful ransomware operation following the shutdown of REvil and BlackMatter. The threat actor 'LockbitSupp' associated with LockBit is adapting tactics to recruit new affiliates. The capability of the threat actor is evidenced by the strategic shutdown and transfer of victims to a competitor. The report was published on November 3, 2021, by Lawrence Abrams on BleepingComputer.

Report 8

DarkSide, a new targeted ransomware operation, has been conducting customized attacks against organizations since August 10, 2020. The threat actors behind DarkSide claim to be former affiliates of other ransomware operations and have already earned million-dollar payouts. They target companies that can pay the specified ransom, with demands ranging from $200,000 to $2,000,000. DarkSide steals data before encrypting victims' systems and posts it on a data leak site for extortion. The ransomware uses novel techniques such as customized ransomware executables, avoiding specific processes during encryption, and utilizing a SALSA20 key for encryption. DarkSide has similarities to the REvil ransomware and purposely avoids infecting victims in CIS countries. The threat actor's capability and use of advanced techniques make them a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape.

Report 10

Summary:
The DarkSide ransomware gang moved approximately 107 BTC ($6.8 million) after news of law enforcement seizing REvil's servers. The funds were split into multiple wallets, indicating preparation for laundering or cashing out. DarkSide, known for the Colonial Pipeline attack, re-launched as BlackMatter and reacted quickly to the REvil takedown. The gang's history of losing control over servers and wallets prompted the move to secure funds. Security firm Profero's CEO, Omri Segev Moyal, notified exchanges to block the gang's wallets. The gang's actions show a fear of losing funds in another law enforcement crackdown. The use of cryptocurrency for illicit activities poses challenges for law enforcement agencies.

Report 21

Summary:
The threat actors CARBON SPIDER and SPRITE SPIDER have recently targeted ESXi servers with ransomware, a novel tactic in big game hunting (BGH) campaigns. CARBON SPIDER, known for targeting POS devices, introduced the Darkside ransomware, while SPRITE SPIDER deployed the Defray777 ransomware on Linux versions designed for ESXi. These attacks aim to maximize impact by encrypting virtual infrastructure, affecting victims across various sectors. The adversaries gain access to ESXi servers using valid credentials and employ techniques like file encryption, data exfiltration, and ransom demands. The use of Linux ransomware and targeting of virtualization infrastructure represent a shift in tactics for these threat actors. The attacks were observed in the second half of 2020, indicating a growing trend towards targeting ESXi servers in BGH operations.

Report 23

Summary:
The threat actor identified as the Darkside ransomware gang has introduced a new tactic to extort companies listed on NASDAQ or other stock markets by threatening to short their stock prices. This move is aimed at pressuring victims to pay the ransom demand, with the belief that negative publicity could impact market listings. The novelty of this technique lies in its formal announcement as an attack vector, making Darkside the first ransomware variant to do so. The threat actor has escalated its extortion tactics, including cold-calls, personal threats, and DDoS threats, as traditional ransom payments decline. However, experts suggest that the effectiveness of shorting victim stock prices is limited, as previous ransomware attacks have not caused long-term damage to companies' market listings. The capability of the threat actor to adapt and innovate in their extortion methods is evident, as they seek new ways to extort money from victims. The report was published on April 22nd, 2021.
