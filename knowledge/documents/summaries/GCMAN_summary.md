Summary:
The threat actor known as GCMAN, along with Metel and Carbanak 2.0, have been involved in APT-style bank robberies targeting financial institutions, particularly in Russia. The attacks involve sophisticated tactics such as reconnaissance, social engineering, specialized malware, and lateral movement tools to steal money from ATMs and money transfer systems. Metel group used a modular malware program to automate ATM balance rollbacks, allowing for multiple transactions without affecting the card balance.

Carbanak 2.0 targeted budgeting and accounting departments beyond banks, changing ownership details of companies. Kaspersky Lab provided crucial Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to help organizations detect these threat actors in their networks. The attacks demonstrate the threat actor's capability to conduct sophisticated and novel cyber-attacks in the financial sector. (Report date: 08 Feb 2016)
