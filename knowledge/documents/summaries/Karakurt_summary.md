Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Karakurt, operating under the alias Karakurt Hacking Team, has targeted over 40 victims across various sectors such as Energy, Entertainment, Healthcare, Hospitality, Industrial, Manufacturing, Retail, and Technology in the USA and Europe. The group is financially motivated and focuses on data exfiltration and extortion rather than ransomware deployment. They use tools like 7-Zip, AnyDesk, Cobalt Strike, FileZilla, Mimikatz, WinZip, and Living off the Land techniques. The threat actor's activities have been observed since 2021, with a reported cyberattack in September 2022 on a migration policy organization. The group's approach includes steps to avoid drawing attention to their activities, indicating a level of sophistication in their operations.





Report 3

Summary:
The Karakurt Data Extortion Group, also known as the Karakurt Team and Karakurt Lair, has been identified as a threat actor by the FBI, CISA, Treasury, and FinCEN. Operating since before January 5, 2022, Karakurt targets victims across North America and Europe, demanding ransom payments ranging from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin. The threat actor employs various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to exfiltrate large volumes of data, including using Cobalt Strike beacons, Mimikatz, AnyDesk, and open source applications like Filezilla and rclone. Karakurt actors have been known to harass victims through emails and phone calls, threatening to auction off or release stolen data unless ransom demands are met. The group has also exaggerated the extent of data stolen and has targeted victims concurrently with other ransomware actors. The U.S. government strongly discourages paying ransoms to Karakurt or any cyber criminals. The threat actor does not appear to target specific sectors or industries, gaining access through stolen credentials, third-party intrusion brokers, and vulnerabilities in VPN appliances, among others. The group has been known to operate on the deep and dark web, with indicators of compromise including email addresses, tools like Rclone.exe and AnyDesk.exe, and malicious documents. The report provides detailed technical information, including MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by Karakurt and mitigation strategies for organizations to protect against such threats. The report was last revised on December 12, 2023.





Report 4

The Karakurt extortion group, also known as Karakurt Team and Karakurt Lair, has been identified as a threat actor targeting organizations primarily in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany. Operating since June 2021, Karakurt is linked to the Conti and Diavol ransomware groups, utilizing tactics like data theft and auctioning or leaking stolen data if ransom demands are not met. The group targets organizations using single-factor Fortigate VPN servers and legitimate Active Directory credentials, gaining administrative access to compromised servers. Karakurt employs tools like Cobalt Strike, AnyDesk, and Mimikatz, and compresses exfiltrated data using 7zip and WinZip before sending it to Mega.io. The ransom demands range from $25,000 to $13 million in Bitcoin, with a payment deadline of seven days after contact. The threat actor has been observed splintering into smaller groups to evade sanctions and law enforcement pressure, highlighting a shift in ransomware tactics. The FBI, CISA, and other federal agencies have issued a joint cybersecurity advisory on Karakurt, recommending mitigation steps such as implementing multi-factor authentication, updating domain control servers, and creating recovery plans. The threat actor's novel techniques and capabilities pose a significant risk to organizations across various sectors.





Report 5

Summary:
The International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) confirmed a cyberattack by the Karakurt extortion group, resulting in a data breach. The attack involved stealing financial documents, banking data, and personal information totaling 375 GB of data. The FBI, CISA, and Treasury Department issued an alert about Karakurt in June 2022, warning of ransom demands ranging from $25,000 to $13 million in Bitcoin. Karakurt is believed to be a spin-off of the Conti ransomware group and has ties to infrastructure used by Conti. The group targets victims based on ease of access, purchasing stolen login credentials or access to compromised systems. The attack on ICMPD occurred in an unspecified time frame, and the organization is currently investigating the incident with the help of internal and external IT experts. The attack highlights the threat actor's capability to conduct sophisticated cyberattacks and leverage stolen data for financial gain.
