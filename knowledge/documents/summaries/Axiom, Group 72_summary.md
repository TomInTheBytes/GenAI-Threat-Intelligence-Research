Report 2

Group 72, also known as Axiom, is a sophisticated threat actor group involved in Operation SMN, targeting high-profile organizations in the manufacturing, industrial, aerospace, defense, and media sectors in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. They use tactics such as watering-hole attacks, spear-phishing, and other web-based tactics. The group has a vulnerability research team searching for 0-day vulnerabilities in Windows and has been associated with initial attack campaigns utilizing exploits for CVE-2014-0322 and CVE-2012-4792. They deploy a variety of remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised machines, including Gh0st RAT, Poison Ivy, HydraQ, Hikit, Zxshell, DeputyDog, Derusbi, and PlugX. Group 72's operational security is strong, but patterns in their domains and email addresses allow for tracking of their activities. The group's tools and infrastructure show some overlap with other threat actor groups, indicating potential connections or shared tactics. The report suggests that Group 72 may be part of a larger organization with multiple teams. The report was published on November 3, 2014, on the Cisco Blogs website.
