Summary:
Operation Windigo, attributed to a threat actor from Russia, has been active since at least 2011, targeting thousands of Linux and Unix servers to steal SSH credentials, redirect web traffic, and send spam. High-profile victims include cPanel and Linux Foundation's kernel.org. The threat actor demonstrates advanced knowledge of operating systems and programming, deploying complex backdoors with portability across server operating systems. The operation exploits known vulnerabilities rather than new ones. The motivation behind the attacks is financial gain. The tools used include Calfbot, CDorked, and Ebury. Counter operations have been reported, such as a Russian citizen pleading guilty in 2017 for involvement in a global botnet conspiracy. The victims operate in various sectors worldwide.
