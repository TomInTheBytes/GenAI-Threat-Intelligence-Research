Summary:
The threat actor known as OPERA1ER has been active since 2016, with digital forensics analysis revealing over 30 successful intrusions between 2018 and 2022. The victims targeted were primarily in the financial and telecommunications sectors in countries such as Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso, and others. OPERA1ER managed to steal at least $11 million during this period, with potential damages reaching $30 million. The threat actor used a variety of tools like Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Agent Tesla, demonstrating advanced capabilities. In 2022, a campaign named Bluebottle targeted banks in French-speaking African countries. In response, in 2023, Operation "Nervone" led to the arrest of a suspected key figure of the cybercrime group.
