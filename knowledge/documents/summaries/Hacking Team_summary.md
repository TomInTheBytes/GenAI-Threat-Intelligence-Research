They provided Remote Control Systems that allowed monitoring of internet users, decryption of encrypted files, recording of communications, and activation of microphones and cameras on target computers. Hacking Team employed around 40 people in Italy and had subsidiary branches in the US and Singapore, with products used in dozens of countries across six continents. They used advanced techniques to avoid detection and had malware payloads for various operating systems. The threat actor faced controversies for selling to governments with poor human rights records, with evidence of sales to Sudan, Bahrain, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.
