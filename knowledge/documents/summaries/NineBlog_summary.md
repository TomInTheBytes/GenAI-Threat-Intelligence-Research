Summary:
The threat actor NineBlog, also known as APT.NineBlog, has been active since 2013, primarily targeting organizations in South Asia and the Middle East, with a spike in activity in mid-2015. They use Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a backdoor, a tactic not commonly seen, making detection difficult due to encoding and SSL network communications. The group's 2015 campaign likely targeted a Southeast Asian government based on decoy documents. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with China being identified as the country of origin. Victims targeted are mainly in the government sector. NineBlog's use of encrypted SSL traffic makes it challenging to develop network-based signatures to detect their activities. The threat actor's capabilities and novel techniques pose a significant challenge to cybersecurity efforts.
