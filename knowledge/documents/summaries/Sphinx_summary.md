Summary:
The threat actor known as Sphinx conducted a cyberespionage campaign targeting sectors in the Middle East, specifically Arabic-speaking users or Middle Eastern countries. The threat actor, also known as Two-tailed Scorpion/APT-C-23, utilized a mobile component called VAMP with a new variant named FrozenCell discovered in October. AnubisSpy, a malicious app linked to the Sphinx campaign, was found to have capabilities to steal various data from mobile devices, including messages, photos, and browser histories. The threat actor used social media sites and legitimate icons to deliver payloads, with a shared C&C server and decryption techniques between AnubisSpy and Sphinx's malware. The malicious apps were distributed in the Middle East, posing as social news, promotional, healthcare, and entertainment apps. AnubisSpy highlights the importance of securing mobile devices, especially in BYOD environments, and Trend Micro disclosed findings to Google for appropriate action. The threat actor's activities suggest a growing trend of cyberespionage on mobile platforms, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures.
