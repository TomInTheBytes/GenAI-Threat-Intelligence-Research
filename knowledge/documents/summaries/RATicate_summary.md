Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor RATicate, also known as Sophos, has been active since November 2019, targeting industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and the Republic of Korea. They use malspam campaigns to distribute remote administration tools and information-stealing malware. The group has been identified in five separate campaigns using similar packing code and command and control infrastructure. A new campaign related to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a shift in tactics. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage. They have used a variety of tools such as Agent Tesla, BetaBot, and LokiBot. The group's origins are unknown, and they have targeted sectors including industrial, manufacturing, media, and telecommunications in countries like Romania, Japan, and Kuwait. The threat actor is constantly evolving their techniques, making them a persistent and dangerous adversary.





Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as RATicate has been conducting malspam campaigns targeting industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and the Republic of Korea since November 2019. They use NSIS installers to drop remote administration tools (RATs) and information-stealing malware on victims' computers. The group has been identified as using various malware families such as Lokibot, Betabot, Formbook, and AgentTesla, all following a multi-stage unpacking process. The threat actor shows evidence of capability through the use of custom loaders and sophisticated techniques to evade analysis, including anti-sandboxing measures. The campaigns have been linked through shared command and control infrastructure and targeting of critical infrastructure providers. The threat actor has shown adaptability by leveraging global events like the COVID-19 pandemic in their phishing tactics. The campaigns have been operated serially, with distinct timelines and common targets across multiple campaigns. The threat actor's motivations are unclear, but they may be involved in corporate espionage or providing malware-as-a-service. The report provides indicators of compromise for tracking the RATicate campaigns.





Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as RATicate has been active since at least last year, spreading remote administration tools (RATs) and other malware through malicious spam email campaigns. They have recently upgraded their attacks by using a new malware loader to install RAT and infostealer payloads more stealthily. The group has also utilized the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure to distribute malware. RATicate has been using a commercial crypter called CloudEyE to evade detection and deploy encrypted payloads via legitimate services like Google Drive. Despite CloudEyE suspending operations, RATicate continues to be active, switching back to using NSIS installers for their campaigns. The group is suspected of acting as a Malware as a Service (MaaS) provider, selling infrastructure to other threat actors. RATicate's use of CloudEyE and NSIS installers, along with their consistent C&C infrastructure, suggests a sophisticated and evolving threat actor. The group's capability to adapt and use novel techniques like commercial crypters demonstrates their advanced capabilities in cyber operations.
