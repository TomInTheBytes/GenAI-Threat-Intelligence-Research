Report 1

In December 2015, Russian banks' employees were targeted with spoofed emails offering fake job offers, delivering Trojan.Ratopak to compromise computers. The threat actor used legitimate-looking emails and a domain similar to the Central Bank of Russia's website to deceive victims. The attackers targeted six Russian banks, focusing on computers using accounting software for tax purposes. The threat actor used the "buh" string in URLs to disguise their activities, leading to the labeling of the threat as "Buhtrap." Trojan.Ratopak checks for language and terminates if not Russian or Ukrainian, showing capability to avoid detection. The attacks appear financially motivated, aiming to steal money or login credentials from targeted banks' employees. Symantec advises caution with unsolicited job offer emails and recommends keeping security software up to date to mitigate such attacks. The threat actor's use of stolen certificates and sophisticated techniques like side-loading demonstrates advanced capabilities.

Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor Buhtrap, also known as Ratopak Spider, has been active since 2014, with their first attacks against financial institutions detected in August 2015. They primarily target Russian and Ukrainian banks, conducting successful attacks resulting in significant financial losses. Buhtrap is notable for being the first hacker group to use a network worm to infect bank infrastructures, making it challenging to remove malicious functions. They have been observed using tools such as Buhtrap, FlawedAmmyy, Niteris EK, and NSIS. The group's motivation is financial crime, with a sponsor type not specified. Buhtrap has been involved in various hacking operations targeting financial and government sectors in Russia and Ukraine. They have also been linked to infrastructure overlap with other threat actors. The group has been known to use novel techniques, such as deploying a zero-day exploit in June 2019. The report covers various hacking operations conducted by Buhtrap, including phishing emails, malware distribution via legitimate software, and targeted email attacks. The threat actor's activities pose a significant risk to financial institutions and government entities in the region.





Report 5

Summary:
The Buhtrap group, known for targeting financial institutions and businesses in Russia, has expanded its operations to include espionage campaigns in Eastern Europe and Central Asia since late 2015. In June 2019, they used a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-1132, for the first time to escalate privileges in Microsoft Windows. The group's tactics have evolved over the years, with the use of NSIS installers, signed tools, and decoy documents tailored to different targets like businesses, banks, and governmental institutions. Novel tools include a password stealer module and the use of Meterpreter with DNS tunneling for communication with C&C servers. The shift towards espionage activities blurs the lines between traditional cybercrime and espionage groups. The report provides indicators of compromise, malware samples, C&C servers, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by the Buhtrap group.

Report 6

Summary:
The threat actor known as Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider targeted victims through a strategic web compromise on the legitimate Ammyy website, distributing malware via an NSIS installer. The victims were primarily Russian businesses, including top Fortune 500 companies and Russian banks. The malware families distributed included Lurk downloader, Corebot, Buhtrap, Ranbyus, and Netwire RAT. The Buhtrap gang utilized a downloader signed with a specific certificate to spy on systems, log keystrokes, and communicate with C&C servers. The threat actor's capability was evidenced by the use of DLL sideloading techniques and the continuous updates to their malware. The novel aspect was the use of strategic web compromises, indicating a shift towards techniques typically seen in targeted attacks. The operation was ongoing as of November 2015, with Ammyy Admin users advised to scan their systems for potential compromise.





Report 7

Summary:
The threat actor known as Buhtrap and RTM has been actively targeting small and midsize businesses, particularly focusing on accountants to gain direct access to finances. The tools used by the threat actor, Buhtrap and RTM, have different functions but the same purpose of stealing money from business accounts. RTM primarily spreads through phishing emails, infecting victims and giving operators full access to systems. Buhtrap, on the other hand, spreads through exploits embedded in news outlets, targeting accountants working in small and medium-sized businesses. The threat actor has shown a significant increase in activity, with over 30,000 users encountering RTM in 2019 and more than 5,000 Buhtrap attack attempts prevented. The majority of RTM targets operate in Russia, but experts expect it to expand to other countries. The threat actor's capability to evade security solutions and the novel use of phishing emails and news outlet exploits demonstrate their advanced tactics. The report was published on February 20, 2019, by Kaspersky.
