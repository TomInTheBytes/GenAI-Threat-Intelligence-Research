Report 1

RedEcho, a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, has been targeting Indian organizations in the energy and maritime sectors since early 2020. The threat actor has been using infrastructure known as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, including ShadowPad C2 servers, to conduct a campaign against India's critical infrastructure, specifically targeting 10 Indian power sector organizations and 2 Indian seaports. Despite similarities with other Chinese state-sponsored groups like APT 41 and Tonto Team, RedEcho is considered a distinct activity group. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage. The tools used by RedEcho include ShadowPad and Winnti. The threat actor's operations have been ongoing since 2020, with evidence of novel techniques and infrastructure tactics. The report was last modified on April 8, 2022.

Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor known as RedEcho, a Chinese government-sponsored cyber-espionage group, targeted India's power grid and critical infrastructure entities, particularly after a border dispute in May 2020. They used backdoor malware like PlugX and ShadowPad to gain access to Indian power sector organizations. The group's operations were exposed in February 2021 by Recorded Future's Insikt Group, who tracked the attacks using unique characteristics in the malware communications. RedEcho took down its attack infrastructure after the exposure, moving domains used to control ShadowPad malware. This action is typical of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like RedEcho, who react to public disclosure by shifting infrastructure. The group's capability and use of novel tools and techniques were evident in their targeted attacks on critical infrastructure. The last activity was spotted on March 11, 2021.
