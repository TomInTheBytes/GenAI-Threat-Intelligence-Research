Report 3

Summary:
The Dark Pink APT group targeted government entities in South Asian countries, specifically ASEAN nations, in a campaign observed in February 2023. The threat actors used the KamiKakaBot malware, delivered via phishing emails containing malicious ISO files. The malware's obfuscation routine was improved to evade anti-malware measures. Dark Pink is an APT group active in the ASEAN region, with origins dating back to mid-2021. The group primarily aims to steal data from web browsers and gain remote code execution on infected devices. They employ evasion techniques like DLL side loading with Winword.exe. The campaign showed overlaps with previous Dark Pink activities, indicating attribution to the group. The threat actors used Telegram as a C2 server and VPN services to hide their identities. Mitigations include safe DLL search mode and disabling browser password saving. The report provides technical details on the malware's execution flow, capabilities, and command and control connections. The Dark Pink APT group is likely to continue evolving its techniques to evade detection.
