Report 13

Summary:
The threat actor "DarkHotel" has been linked to a cyber-espionage toolkit named Ramsay, tailored for air-gapped networks. ESET researchers discovered Ramsay, capable of collecting and exfiltrating sensitive documents within isolated systems. Evidence suggests Ramsay is still in a developmental stage, with low visibility of victims, possibly due to the nature of air-gapped networks. The threat actor behind Ramsay has targeted government entities in China and Japan, with attack vectors including malicious documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 and trojanized applications. Ramsay's capabilities include file collection, covert storage, command execution, spreading via file infection, and decentralized control protocol. The threat actor demonstrates sophistication by reusing tokens and techniques seen in DarkHotel's Retro Backdoor. Ramsay's persistence mechanisms and evasion tactics indicate a high level of sophistication, with indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques provided. The threat actor's novel tools and techniques, along with the targeting of air-gapped networks, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Date of report: 13 May 2020.
