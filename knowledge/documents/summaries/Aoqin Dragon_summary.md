Summary:
The threat actor "Aoqin Dragon" is a Chinese-linked APT group that has been operating since 2013, targeting government, education, and telecommunication organizations in Southeast Asia and Australia. They use document exploits, fake removable devices, DLL hijacking, Themida-packed files, and DNS tunneling to evade detection.
