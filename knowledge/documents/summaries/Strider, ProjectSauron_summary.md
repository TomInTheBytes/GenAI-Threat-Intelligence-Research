Report 1

Strider, a cyberespionage group known as ProjectSauron, has been targeting organizations and individuals in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium since at least October 2011. The group uses advanced malware called Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) for spying purposes, with references to Sauron from Lord of the Rings in its code. Strider has infected 36 computers across seven organizations, including an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium. The Remsec malware has stealth features, modular design, and uses Lua modules for various functions like keylogging and network communication. Strider's technical capabilities and selective targeting suggest it may be a nation-state level attacker. Symantec and Norton products detect the threat as Backdoor.Remsec. The report provides indicators of compromise for identifying the threat in an environment. The group's novel tools and techniques, along with its long-term operation, indicate a sophisticated and persistent threat actor.
