Cadet Blizzard has also engaged in hack-and-leak operations, defacements of Ukrainian organization websites, and targeted government organizations and IT providers in Ukraine, Europe, and Latin America. Their activities are structured to deliver impact and pose a risk to network operations and sensitive information. The threat actor's tools include GO Simple Tunnel, Impacket, netcat, P0wnyshell, reGeorg, WhisperGate, and Living off the Land techniques. Cadet Blizzard's operations are sponsored by the Russian government with motivations of information theft, espionage, sabotage, and destruction. The threat actor's activities are a notable development in the Russian cyber threat landscape, particularly in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.





Report 2

Cadet Blizzard is a novel and distinct Russian threat actor associated with the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). They have been operational since at least 2020 and have engaged in destructive cyber operations likely supporting broader military objectives in Ukraine. Cadet Blizzard has been linked to the creation and deployment of WhisperGate, a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs), against Ukrainian government organizations. They have targeted government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine, Europe, and Latin America. Cadet Blizzard utilizes living-off-the-land techniques for lateral movement, credential harvesting, and privilege escalation. They have been observed using tools like P0wnyshell, reGeorg, PAS, and custom web shells for persistence. Cadet Blizzard's operations are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering network operations and exposing sensitive information. Microsoft has been working with CERT-UA to protect against Cadet Blizzard's cyberattacks and has shared information with the global security community to address this evolving threat. Organizations are advised to actively protect their environments against Cadet Blizzard and take steps to detect and prevent disruption.





Report 3

Cadet Blizzard, a novel and distinct Russian threat actor, has been identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) targeting Ukrainian organizations with destructive malware. The malware, designed to appear as ransomware but lacking a ransom recovery mechanism, aims to render targeted devices inoperable. The malware was first observed on victim systems in Ukraine on January 13, 2022. The malware overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) with a fake ransom note containing a Bitcoin wallet and Tox ID. The malware has been found on dozens of impacted systems across government, non-profit, and information technology organizations in Ukraine. The malware's unique capabilities include overwriting files with a fixed number of bytes and renaming them with random extensions. Microsoft has implemented protections to detect this malware family as WhisperGate and advises organizations to conduct thorough investigations and implement defenses. The threat actor's tools and techniques, including the use of Tox ID for communication, are considered novel and pose an elevated risk to government agencies, non-profits, and enterprises in Ukraine. Microsoft continues to monitor the activity and collaborate with the global security community to address this evolving threat.
