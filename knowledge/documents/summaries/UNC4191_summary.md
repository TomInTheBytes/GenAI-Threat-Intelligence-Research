Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor UNC4191, with a China nexus, has been identified by Mandiant for cyber espionage activities in Southeast Asia, primarily targeting the Philippines. The threat actor leverages USB devices for initial infection and deploys new malware families named MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE. The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives, allowing for data collection from air-gapped systems. Mandiant observed evidence of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can evade traditional detection mechanisms. The threat actor's capability to side-load malware using legitimately signed binaries and the use of novel malware families demonstrate their advanced capabilities. The campaign potentially extends back to September 2021, showcasing Chinese operations for intelligence collection related to political and commercial interests. Mandiant has deployed new real-time detections to enhance protection against similar activities. The threat actor's use of new infrastructure and tools with advanced capabilities poses a significant threat to public and private sector entities in Southeast Asia and beyond.
