Report 2

Earth Wendigo is a threat actor targeting organizations in Taiwan since May 2019, aiming to exfiltrate emails via JavaScript backdoors injected into a widely-used webmail system. The threat actor, named Earth Wendigo, targeted government organizations, research institutions, and universities in Taiwan, as well as individuals supporting movements in Tibet, the Uyghur region, or Hong Kong. They used spear-phishing emails with malicious links and injected JavaScript into email signatures for propagation. Earth Wendigo leveraged Service Worker, a web browser feature, for the first time in an attack to intercept and manipulate HTTPS requests. The threat actor established WebSocket connections for mailbox exfiltration, and also deployed malware variants written in Python for additional attacks. The campaign demonstrates atypical techniques like mail signature manipulation and Service Worker infection, emphasizing the importance of security best practices and server upgrades to prevent compromise.
