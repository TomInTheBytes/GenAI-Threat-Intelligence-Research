Report 5

Summary:
The threat actor known as LAPSUS$ is an extortion group that gained attention in early 2022 for flashy and disruptive attacks primarily targeting companies in South America, Portugal, and multinational technology companies. The group operates through a private Telegram group and focuses on opportunistic data theft and threats to release stolen data.
