Report 2

North Korean hacking group Kumsong 121 has recently employed social media platforms to launch cyberattacks, targeting Android smartphone users through smishing attacks. The group's advanced persistent threat (APT) activity was discovered by EST Security, showcasing the sophistication of North Korea's cyber capabilities. Instead of traditional email phishing, the threat actors befriended victims on social media and sent infected files to compromise their devices. By leveraging spear-phishing techniques on social media, the hackers targeted specific individuals and expanded their network by contacting victims' acquaintances. Kumsong 121 utilized a mobile application optimized for Android devices to conduct smishing attacks, gaining access to victims' personal information. The threat actor also attempted to distribute malware by hijacking the social media account of a North Korean defector. This novel approach highlights the evolving tactics of North Korean hackers, posing a significant threat to users' cybersecurity. (Report date: Sep 13, 2021)
