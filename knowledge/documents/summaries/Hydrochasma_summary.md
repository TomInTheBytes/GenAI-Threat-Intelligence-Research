Report 2

Hydrochasma, a threat actor first seen in 2022, has been targeting shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia in an intelligence-gathering campaign using publicly available tools. The campaign, ongoing since at least October 2022, shows a focus on industries related to COVID-19 treatments or vaccines. While no data exfiltration has been observed, the tools used suggest the primary motivation is intelligence gathering. The threat actor has not been linked to any known group and utilizes tools like BrowserGhost, Cobalt Strike, and Living off the Land techniques. The sponsor type is unknown, with the motivation being information theft and espionage. Victims operate in the healthcare, shipping, and logistics sectors in Asia. The threat actor's capabilities and novel use of tools indicate a sophisticated and potentially state-sponsored actor.
