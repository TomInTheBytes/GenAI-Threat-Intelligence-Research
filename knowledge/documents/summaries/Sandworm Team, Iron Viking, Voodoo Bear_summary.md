Report 1

Sandworm Team, also known as Iron Viking and Voodoo Bear, has been actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in the Windows operating system (CVE-2014-4114) to deliver Backdoor.Lancafdo.A malware to targeted organizations in the US and Europe. The vulnerability allows attackers to embed OLE files from external locations, enabling the download and installation of malware on the target's computer. The attacks have targeted NATO, Ukrainian government organizations, Western European governmental organizations, energy sector companies, European telecoms firms, and a US academic organization. The exploitation has been ongoing since August, with spear-phishing emails containing malicious PowerPoint file attachments being used to deliver the malware. Symantec detects the malware payload as Backdoor.Lancafdo.A and advises affected Windows users to apply security patches from Microsoft, keep security software up-to-date, and exercise caution when opening email attachments. The vulnerability is considered critical as it allows remote code execution on the target's computer, and Microsoft has issued a security patch to address it. The threat actor's capability to exploit this vulnerability and use novel techniques like embedding URLs in OLE documents highlights their advanced persistent threat (APT) capabilities.

Report 8

Summary: The Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Sandworm breached 11 Ukrainian telecommunication service providers between May and September 2023, as reported by Ukraine's CERT-UA. The group utilized phishing lures, Android malware, and data-wipers to target telcos, focusing on reconnaissance using tools like 'masscan' to scan networks for vulnerabilities. Sandworm employed backdoors like 'Poemgate' and 'Poseidon' to gain access to admin credentials and control systems remotely. They used tools like 'Whitecat' to cover their tracks and deployed scripts to disrupt services, particularly targeting Mikrotik equipment. The attacks were sophisticated and aimed at causing service interruptions and data breaches in the Ukrainian telco sector. Date: October 16, 2023.





Report 9

Summary: Russian hackers, specifically the Sandworm Team, have been targeting Ukraine with Follina exploits, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) tracked as CVE-2022-30190. The attacks have been ongoing since at least April 2022, with evidence pointing to the Sandworm hacker group as the perpetrators. The threat actors targeted media organizations in Ukraine, including radio stations and newspapers, through a malicious email campaign. The malware named "CrescentImp" was used in the attacks, with indicators of compromise provided by CERT-UA. Sandworm's activities in Ukraine have increased following the Russian invasion, with previous attacks targeting energy providers and operating the Cyclops Blink botnet. The U.S. has offered a reward for information on members of the Sandworm group. The threat actor's capability is demonstrated through the use of novel tools and techniques, highlighting the evolving nature of cyber threats. 

Date: June 13, 2022

Region: Ukraine

Operating Sector: Media organizations

Type of Company: Radio stations and newspapers

Evidence of Capability: Exploitation of Follina vulnerability, use of malicious email campaigns, targeting critical infrastructure, creation of persistent malware, and involvement in high-profile cyber incidents.





Report 10

Summary: The Russian threat actor group known as Sandworm utilized WinRAR to wipe data from Ukrainian state agency devices. The attack involved compromised VPN accounts without multi-factor authentication to access critical systems. The threat actors used a BAT script named RoarBat on Windows machines to search for specific file types and delete them using WinRAR with the "-df" command-line option. On Linux systems, a Bash script was used with the "dd" utility to overwrite target file types. The attack, similar to a previous incident in January 2023, aimed to destroy data effectively. The threat actors' use of legitimate programs like WinRAR and dd likely helped evade detection by security software. The incident highlights the need for organizations to enhance security measures, patch vulnerabilities, and monitor network activity. Date: May 3, 2023. Region: Ukraine. Operating Sector: State agency. Company Type: Government.

Report 12

Sandworm Team, also known as Iron Viking and Voodoo Bear, disrupted power in Ukraine through a novel attack against operational technology in late 2022. The threat actor targeted a critical infrastructure organization in Ukraine, leveraging living off the land (LotL) techniques to trip substation circuit breakers, causing a power outage coinciding with missile strikes. Sandworm later deployed a new variant of CADDYWIPER in the victim's IT environment. This attack showcased Russia's evolving cyber physical attack capability, indicating a growing maturity in offensive operational technology (OT) arsenal. Sandworm's ability to quickly develop OT capabilities, potentially within two months, suggests a significant threat to OT systems globally. The attack, tracked as UNC3810 before merging with Sandworm, highlights the group's focus on Ukraine and its disruptive and destructive campaigns. Sandworm's use of LotL techniques and streamlined OT attack capabilities reveal insights into Russia's offensive cyber capabilities. The attack coincided with Russian kinetic operations, indicating strategic timing. Sandworm's global threat activity and novel OT capabilities pose an immediate threat to critical infrastructure worldwide, urging asset owners to take mitigation actions.
