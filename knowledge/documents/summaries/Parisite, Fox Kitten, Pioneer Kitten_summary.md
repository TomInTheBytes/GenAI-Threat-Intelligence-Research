Report 2

Summary:
- Threat actor named Magnallium, associated with Iran-linked APT33, has expanded targeting from global oil-and-gas industry to electric companies in North America.
- A subgroup of Magnallium called Parisite was observed targeting known VPN vulnerabilities at electric targets in the U.S., focusing on utilities, aerospace, and oil-and-gas entities.
- Parisite uses open-source tools and known vulnerabilities for initial access, operating since at least 2017.
- Magnallium, active since 2013, has targeted energy and aerospace entities, with recent focus on electric utilities in the U.S.
- Magnallium uses phishing emails with StoneDrill wiper and TurnedUp malware variants to steal data, along with PowerShell-based post-exploitation tools.
- Another threat actor, Xenotime, known for the 2017 Trisis attack on a Saudi Arabian petrochemical facility, has been targeting supply chains related to electric entities in North America.
- Xenotime has compromised several ICS vendors and manufacturers, posing a potential supply-chain threat.
- Adversaries are leveraging trusted relationships to infiltrate target networks, indicating a shift towards offensive capabilities for ICS-targeting operations.
- The trend of targeting multiple industrial verticals for espionage, information gathering, and potentially disruptive events is increasing due to the availability of offensive capabilities and wider attack surface.
- The report highlights the growing threat landscape in critical infrastructure sectors, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures.





Report 3

PIONEER KITTEN, an Iran-based threat actor active since at least 2017, is suspected to have ties to the Iranian government and focuses on espionage. The threat actor targets entities in Israel, MENA, North America, and the United States, with a particular interest in Technology, Government, Defense, and Healthcare sectors. PIONEER KITTEN's tradecraft includes exploiting VPNs and network appliances, using open-source tools like Ngrok and SSHMinion for communication and hands-on-keyboard activity. The threat actor has been observed selling access to compromised networks, indicating a potential revenue diversification effort. PIONEER KITTEN's targets include a wide range of sectors, such as technology, government, defense, healthcare, aviation, media, and financial services. The threat actor's reliance on novel techniques and tools, along with its opportunistic operational model, make it a significant concern for organizations in various industries.





Report 4

Parisite, Fox Kitten, and Pioneer Kitten are threat actors originating from Iran, with Parisite serving as the initial access group enabling further operations for APT 33, Elfin, and Magnallium. The Fox Kitten Campaign, discovered by ClearSky in late 2019, targeted companies in sectors such as IT, Telecommunication, Oil and Gas, Aviation, Government, and Security worldwide. The threat actors exploited 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services like Pulse Secure VPN and Fortinet VPN to gain access to networks, maintaining access through various communication tools like RDP links over SSH tunneling. The attackers focused on stealing sensitive information for reconnaissance, espionage, or further network infection. The tools used by the threat actors included FRP, Invoke the Hash, JuicyPotato, Ngrok, and others. The observed attacked sectors included Aviation, Chemical, Energy, Defense, Engineering, Financial, Government, Healthcare, IT, Media, Manufacturing, Oil and gas, Retail, and Telecommunications in countries like Australia, USA, Germany, and others. The threat actors' motivation was information theft and espionage. The operations of these threat actors were reported in various campaigns like Fox Kitten and Pay2Kitten, with evidence of exploiting CVEs related to Pulse Secure VPN, Citrix NetScaler, and F5 vulnerabilities. The report provides insights into the capabilities and techniques used by these threat actors, highlighting their persistence and sophistication in targeting a wide range of sectors and countries.





Report 5

The report titled "The State of Threats to Electric Entities in North America" by Dragos highlights the increasing risk of disruptive or destructive attacks on the electric sector in North America. Two threat groups, MAGNALLIUM and XENOTIME, have expanded their targeting from oil and gas to include electric systems. A new activity group called PARISITE, identified in 2019, focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN appliances to gain access to target ICS networks. The report emphasizes the growing trend of threats expanding from single-vertical ICS operations to multi-vertical operations. Supply chain and third-party compromises pose significant risks to the electric sector, along with adversaries exploiting remote connectivity services. The report provides defensive recommendations for asset owners and operators to combat these observed threats. The threat actor operates in the electric sector in North America and targets companies and utilities in the energy infrastructure sector. The report was published on January 9, 2020.
