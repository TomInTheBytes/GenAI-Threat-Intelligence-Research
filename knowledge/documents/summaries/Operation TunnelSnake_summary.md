Report 2

Summary:
Operation TunnelSnake, conducted by an unknown threat actor, involved the deployment of a newly discovered Windows rootkit named Moriya. The rootkit allowed for passive backdoors on public-facing servers, creating covert communication channels for remote control. The threat actor targeted regional diplomatic organizations in Asia and Africa, with evidence of activity dating back to 2018. The threat actor used a toolset for lateral movement, including a tool formerly used by APT1. The attacker also deployed a rootkit named IISSpy to target IIS servers. The threat actor also used a malware named ProcessKiller to shut down and block security processes. The campaign was highly targeted, with less than 10 victims worldwide, including large regional diplomatic organizations. The threat actor remains unidentified, but is suspected to be Chinese-speaking based on TTPs and tools used. The campaign demonstrates a sophisticated actor investing significant resources in evasive toolsets for high-profile organization infiltration.
