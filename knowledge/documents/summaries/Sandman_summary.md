Report 1

Sandman, a threat actor first seen in 2022, was observed by SentinelLabs in collaboration with QGroup GmbH targeting the telecommunications sector in August 2023. The threat actor utilized a novel modular backdoor named LuaDream based on the LuaJIT platform. Sandman's activities involved strategic lateral movement to specific workstations with minimal engagement to avoid detection. The threat actor's motivation was information theft and espionage, with China identified as the country of origin. Victims targeted by Sandman operated in the telecommunications sector in the Middle East, Western Europe, and South Asia. The use of the LuaDream tool indicated the capability and sophistication of the threat actor. The report did not mention specific dates or operation time windows.





Report 2

Sandman APT, a threat actor targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East, Western Europe, and the South Asian subcontinent, has been observed using a novel modular backdoor named LuaDream based on the LuaJIT platform. The threat actor's activities involve strategic lateral movements and minimal engagements to avoid detection. The implementation of LuaDream indicates a well-executed, actively developed project of considerable scale. Sandman's focus on telcos and the use of LuaJIT in APT malware, historically rare but becoming broader, suggest espionage motivations. The threat actor's activities took place over several weeks in August 2023, targeting specific workstations with a sophisticated loading process for LuaDream. Sandman's infrastructure management practices evolved to avoid detection, with C2 servers shifting to load balancing platforms. Attribution of Sandman remains elusive, highlighting the continuous innovation in cyber espionage. The report provides indicators of compromise and insights into Sandman's capabilities and infrastructure.





Report 3

Summary:
The Sandman APT, associated with suspected China-based threat clusters, was observed using the Lua-based malware LuaDream and the KEYPLUG backdoor in victim environments. Sandman and STORM-0866/Red Dev 40 share infrastructure control practices, indicating shared development practices. The use of Lua in cyberespionage, historically Western-associated, suggests broader adoption by adversaries, including those linked to China. Sandman targeted entities in the Middle East and South Asian subcontinent, similar to STORM-0866/Red Dev 40. The threat actor's infrastructure overlaps with STORM-0866/Red Dev 40, showcasing cooperation among China-based threat groups. The threat actor's use of LuaDream and KEYPLUG reveals shared functionalities and design, indicating shared requirements by operators. The threat actor's C2 protocols, execution flow, and C2 data management show similarities between LuaDream and KEYPLUG, suggesting shared operational practices. The threat actor's infrastructure, targeting, and TTPs associate Sandman with China-based adversaries using the KEYPLUG backdoor, highlighting the complexity of the Chinese threat landscape. The adoption of Lua in cyberespionage signifies evolving tactics by threat actors.
