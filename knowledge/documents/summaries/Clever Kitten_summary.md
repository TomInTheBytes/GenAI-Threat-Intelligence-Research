Report 2

Summary:
The threat actor known as Clever Kitten, affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran, primarily targets global companies with strategic importance to countries contrary to Iranian interests. They utilize PHP server-side attacks and strategic web compromises, favoring web servers as their targets. Clever Kitten conducts reconnaissance using the Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner and uploads a PHP backdoor (RC SHELL v2.0.2011.1009) for remote access. Their goal is lateral movement within the target environment for intelligence collection, leveraging vulnerability scanners and packet-sniffing utilities to compromise credentials. Evidence points to an Iranian nexus, with language artifacts and network activity linking the actor to a specific location. The report highlights the importance of detecting reconnaissance activities and provides Snort IDS rules for identifying Acunetix scans and RC SHELL responses. The operation time window is ongoing, and Clever Kitten's techniques demonstrate a novel approach to targeted attacks.
