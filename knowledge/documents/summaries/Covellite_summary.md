Covellite, a threat actor also known as CTG-2460 and Black Artemis, has been active since 2017, targeting civilian electric energy networks globally for information theft and espionage. Operating primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America, Covellite has used targeted phishing campaigns with malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect computers with malware, enabling covert access to victims' machines. The group's infrastructure and malware show similarities to the Lazarus Group, indicating an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. Despite technical overlap, the relationship between Covellite and Lazarus remains unclear. With a focus on infrastructure operations and aggressive targeting, Covellite poses a significant threat to the ICS industry. The threat actor is sponsored by North Korea and has targeted companies in the energy sector in the USA, Europe, and East Asia. The report was last modified on January 7, 2021.
