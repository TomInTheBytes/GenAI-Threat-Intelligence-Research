Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as WINDSHIFT targeted Middle Eastern governments, specifically a government agency, between January and May of 2018. The attacker used the WINDTAIL backdoor family and Mac OSX app bundles in zip archives for their attacks. The attacker's TTPs suggest spearphishing was involved in the initial infection attempt. Unit 42 identified specific C2 server IP addresses and domains associated with WINDSHIFT activity. The attacker attempted to establish persistence within the targeted environment but Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that they were not successful. The attacker used Mac OSX developer certificates tied to WINDSHIFT malware. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat, and IOCs have been shared with the Cyber Threat Alliance. The evidence suggests a possible connection between WINDSHIFT and Operation Hangover threat actor activities.
