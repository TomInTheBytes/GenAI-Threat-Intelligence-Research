Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor CyberAv3ngers, affiliated with the Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been actively targeting and compromising Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in the Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) Sector, as well as other industries like energy, food and beverage manufacturing, and healthcare. The IRGC's motivation is sabotage and destruction, with reported attacks in Ireland, Israel, and the USA. The threat actor has been linked to cyberattacks on a Pennsylvania water authority and causing a two-day water outage in Ireland. The tools and techniques used by CyberAv3ngers are novel and pose a significant threat to industrial sectors. The threat actor's state-sponsored nature and destructive motivations make them a serious concern for critical infrastructure security.





Report 2

The threat actor "CyberAv3ngers," affiliated with the Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been targeting and compromising Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in multiple sectors, including U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) facilities. The threat actor has been active since at least November 22, 2023, compromising default credentials in Unitronics devices and leaving defacement messages indicating anti-Israel sentiments. The victims span multiple U.S. states, urging critical infrastructure organizations to apply recommended mitigations. The threat actor, known as CyberAv3ngers, has connections to another IRGC-linked group called Soldiers of Solomon. The threat actor's activities involve exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security and exposure to the internet, to compromise PLCs. The threat actor's tactics include using brute force techniques to obtain login credentials and gain root-level access to devices. The authoring agencies recommend implementing multifactor authentication, strong passwords, and disconnecting PLCs from public-facing internet to mitigate risks. The threat actor's activities are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and organizations are advised to validate security controls against these techniques. The report was last updated on December 14, 2023, providing additional information on CVEs, IOCs, and mitigations.





Report 3

Summary:
On November 27th, 2023, the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania was targeted in a cyberattack allegedly tied to the pro-Iran group Cyber Av3ngers. The attack did not affect the drinking water supply but impacted the water pressure regulation system. The attackers gained access to a pump that regulates pressure in elevated areas of the system, which was on a separate network from the primary one. The group has claimed attacks on water treatment plants in Israel and has ties to Iran. Congressman Chris Deluzio is closely monitoring the situation, emphasizing the need for a full investigation and accountability for the attackers. The attack occurred after efforts to enhance cybersecurity in water systems were opposed by industry groups, despite acknowledging the increasing threat of cyberattacks on water utilities. Law enforcement agencies reported ransomware attacks on five U.S. water facilities from 2019 to 2021.





Report 4

Summary:
On December 11th, 2023, a two-day water outage in a remote region of County Mayo, Ireland, affecting approximately 160 households, was caused by a cyberattack carried out by a pro-Iran hacking group known as Cyber Av3ngers. The attack targeted a programmable logic controller vulnerability in a water system that used Israel-made Unitronics tools. The incident was part of a global exploitation campaign, with the Irish government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and An Garda Síochána engaging with the affected entity. The U.S. federal government had previously warned about active exploitation of Unitronics PLCs in various sectors, including water, energy, food, and healthcare. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the Unitronics bug to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, assigning it CVE-2023-6448, highlighting the threat actor's capability and the novelty of the tools and techniques used. The incident underscores the importance of cybersecurity in critical infrastructure sectors.
