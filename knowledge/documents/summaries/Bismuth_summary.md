Report 2

Bismuth, a threat actor sharing similarities with OceanLotus or APT32, has been conducting cyberespionage attacks since 2012, targeting large multinational corporations, governments, financial services, educational institutions, and human and civil rights organizations. In July to August 2020, Bismuth deployed Monero coin miners in attacks targeting the private sector and government institutions in France and Vietnam. The threat actor utilized DLL side-loading, phishing emails, and evasive PowerShell scripts to establish persistence, move laterally, and blend in with legitimate applications. Bismuth's deployment of coin miners was unexpected but consistent with their strategy of staying under the radar. The group's activities involved credential theft, lateral movement, and planting multiple persistence methods, showcasing the complexity of responding to their attacks. Microsoft recommends organizations to limit the attack surface, enforce credential hygiene, and contain attacker movement to defend against threats like Bismuth. The report provides detailed technical insights into Bismuth's attacks and mitigation recommendations for building organizational resilience. Date of publication: December 12, 2020.
