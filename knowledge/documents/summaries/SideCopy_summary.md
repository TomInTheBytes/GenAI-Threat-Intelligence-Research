Report 1

The threat actor known as "SideCopy" has been active since early 2019 and has been targeting Indian defense forces and armed forces personnel. The threat actor is constantly developing malware modules and updating them after reconnaissance of victim data. They are adept at evading detection by updating modules when detected by antivirus software. The threat actor has been using similar server names to those found in the Transparent Tribe report, misleading the security community by copying tactics from the Sidewinder APT group. The threat actor has been using various infection vectors, including LNK files and template injection attacks, to deliver payloads to victims. The operation has been ongoing since early 2019, with evidence of three infection chain processes observed. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by their use of novel techniques such as template injection attacks and their focus on targeting critical Indian organizations. The report provides detailed analysis and attribution of the threat actor's activities. (Source: https://www.seqrite.com/blog/operation-sidecopy/)





Report 2

SideCopy, a Pakistan-linked APT group, has been targeting Indian government and defense entities, leveraging WinRAR zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-38831 to deploy AllaKore RAT, DRat, and additional payloads. They have reused compromised domains and deployed a Linux variant of Ares RAT, showing code similarity with Transparent Tribe (APT36). SideCopy and APT36 share infrastructure and code to target India aggressively. The threat actor has been active since 2013, continuously updating its arsenal with new RATs like Action RAT, AllaKore RAT, and more. They have used honey traps to steal confidential intel through cyber espionage. The threat actor has conducted multi-platform attacks simultaneously, targeting Indian websites with DDoS, defacement, and data breach attacks. The campaigns have connections to sharing code and infrastructure between these closely related threat groups. The threat actor has expanded its Linux arsenal and is constantly updating its tools and techniques. The campaigns have been attributed to SideCopy with high confidence, showing an uptick in activity amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict.





Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor "SideCopy" is a notorious APT group from Pakistan targeting South Asian nations, particularly India and Afghanistan. Recently, they launched a campaign against India's DRDO, a government agency focused on defense technologies. The attack involves a complex chain of infection using malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to deploy final payloads, including the Action RAT malware. The group utilizes DLL Sideloading techniques and continuously evolves its tactics to avoid detection. The attack involves multiple stages, from initial infection via spam emails to data exfiltration and persistence on the victim's system. The threat actor's capability is evidenced by the use of novel tools and techniques, such as Base64 encoding, dynamic loading of DLL files, and information-stealing malware. The attack was reported in March 2023 by Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs.





Report 4

SideCopy, a threat actor operating since early 2019, has been exclusively targeting Indian defense and armed forces personnel. The threat actor is constantly developing and updating malware modules, with new modules released after reconnaissance of victim data. They are known to mislead the security community by copying tactics from other APT groups like SideWinder and Rattlesnake. SideCopy has been linked to Transparent Tribe and APT 36 APT groups. The threat actor's motivation is information theft and espionage, with a country of origin in Pakistan. They have been observed using a variety of RATs such as Allakore RAT and njRAT. Notable hacking operations include targeting Indian government entities and leveraging WinRAR Zero-Day and Linux Variant of Ares RAT. Counter operations against SideCopy have been reported in Pakistan and Syria.





Report 5

Summary:
The SideCopy APT, a Pakistani threat actor operating since at least 2019, targets South Asian countries, specifically India and Afghanistan. They use lures like Microsoft Publisher documents and Trojanized applications to compromise victims, including government and military officials. The threat actor exfiltrates sensitive data like government portals access, social media credentials, and banking information. They have a newly observed stealer called AuTo stealer. The actor's infrastructure includes unique C2 servers and monitoring systems. The tools and techniques used by SideCopy APT show sophistication and continuous evolution. The report provides detailed IOCs, attacker infrastructure, victimology, and analysis of the new attacks. The report was published on December 2, 2021, by the Threat Intelligence Team.





Report 6

Summary:
APT SideCopy, a Pakistani threat group, targeted Indian Government Entities using spear-phishing emails with macro-enabled Word documents. The attack involved a new version of ReverseRAT with enhanced obfuscation and sleep calls to avoid detection. Once gaining persistence, ReverseRAT collected and encrypted data using RC4, sending it to a Command and Control server. The malware's functions included taking screenshots, downloading and executing files, and uploading files to the C2 server. The attack was reported on ThreatMon's platform, showcasing the threat actor's capabilities and novel techniques. The operation time window was not specified in the report.
