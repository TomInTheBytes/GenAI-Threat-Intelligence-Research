Report 2

Flying Kitten, also known as Ajax Security Team, is a state-sponsored threat actor originating from Iran. They have been active since 2010, initially engaging in website defacements under the name "AjaxTM" before transitioning to malware-based espionage by 2014. This group has targeted U.S.-based defense contractors and political dissidents, with a focus on information theft and espionage. Their tools and techniques include the use of a stealer. Notably, they have been tracked by both FireEye and CrowdStrike, with FireEye reporting on their Operation "Saffron Rose" in 2013. The threat actor's capabilities and novel tactics make them a significant concern in the cybersecurity landscape.
