Report 2

UNC3524 is a suspected espionage threat actor that targets the emails of employees involved in corporate development, mergers, and acquisitions. The threat actor has been observed to remain undetected in victim environments for at least 18 months, showcasing advanced operational security and evasive skills. UNC3524 uses a novel backdoor called QUIETEXIT, based on Dropbear SSH client-server software, deployed on network appliances within victim environments. The threat actor also utilizes a web shell named REGEORG for alternate access. UNC3524 demonstrates low malware footprint, reliance on built-in Windows protocols for lateral movement, and sophisticated operational security. The threat actor targets executive teams and employees in victim organizations to extract mail items using Exchange Web Services API requests. UNC3524's infrastructure primarily consists of compromised IoT devices like conference room cameras, making host-based detection challenging. Mandiant recommends network-based monitoring for SSH traffic and outbound traffic from unmonitored devices to detect UNC3524's activities. The threat actor's use of compromised appliances and sophisticated operational security make detection and remediation challenging for victim organizations. The report was last updated in November 2022.
