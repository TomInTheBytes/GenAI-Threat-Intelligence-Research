Report 1

Earth Berberoka, also known as GamblingPuppet, is an advanced persistent threat group targeting gambling websites primarily in Southeast Asia, specifically in the casinos and gambling sector. The threat actor utilizes malware families historically linked to Chinese-speaking individuals and operates on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. Their motivation is information theft and espionage, with observed tools including AsyncRAT, Gh0st RAT, oRAT, PlugX, PuppetLoader, QuasarRAT, and Trochilus RAT. The threat actor was first seen in 2022, with evidence pointing to China as their country of origin. The novelty of their tools and techniques lies in their targeting of the gambling sector and the use of known malware families.





Report 2

Earth Berberoka is a new APT group targeting gambling websites on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms using old and new malware families. The group has been historically attributed to Chinese-speaking individuals and uses malware families like PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and a new multistage malware family called PuppetLoader. PuppetLoader is a complex five-stage malware family that uses techniques like hijacking loaded modules and hiding payloads in BMP files. The group also uses oRAT, MFC socket downloaders, and legitimate tools like Quasar RAT and AsyncRAT. Earth Berberoka's capability to target the Southeast Asian gambling market is evident through their use of multiple tools and infrastructure. The group's use of destructive features like replacing the MBR with explicit messages in Gh0st RAT variants adds to their threat level. The report provides security recommendations to avoid falling victim to Earth Berberoka's attacks. The operation time window is not specified in the report.
