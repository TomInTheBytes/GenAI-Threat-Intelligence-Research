Report 1

Chinese threat actor group known as 'Space Pirates' has been targeting Russian aerospace firms since 2017, using phishing emails to install novel malware on their systems. The group has links to known threat actors like APT41, Mustang Panda, and APT27, but is considered a new cluster of malicious activity. Operating in Russia, Georgia, and Mongolia, Space Pirates have targeted government agencies and enterprises in IT services, aerospace, and electric power industries. Evidence shows that the threat actors have successfully compromised Russian companies with state participation, maintaining access to servers for extended periods and stealing sensitive data. The group's arsenal includes custom loaders, backdoors, and malware tools like PlugX, ShadowPad, and Deed RAT, with a focus on espionage operations to steal confidential information. The use of previously undocumented modular malware tools like Deed RAT, BH_A006, and MyKLoadClient demonstrates the group's advanced capabilities. The threat analysts believe that the overlaps between various Chinese APTs are due to tool exchanges, making it challenging for analysts to attribute attacks to specific threat groups. The Chinese threat actors have shown aggression against Russian targets, particularly in industries like aerospace, weapons, electrical engineering, shipbuilding, and nuclear technology. The report does not specify a specific date or operation time window for the Space Pirates' activities.

Report 4

Summary:
The threat actor known as "Space Pirates" was discovered by the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) in late 2019 and has been active since at least 2017. They have targeted at least 16 organizations in Russia and one in Serbia, including government and educational institutions, private security companies, aerospace manufacturers, defense, energy, and infosec companies. The threat actor's main goals are espionage and theft of confidential information, with a focus on Russian companies. They have developed new tools like Deed RAT and Voidoor, with unique capabilities such as using GitHub repositories for communication and persistence. The threat actor also uses a variety of publicly available network tools and has shown a reduction in the use of other backdoors while increasing attacks with Deed RAT. The Space Pirates group continues to pose a significant threat to organizations, and the PT ESC team is actively monitoring and responding to their activities.
