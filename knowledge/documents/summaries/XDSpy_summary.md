Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor XDSpy, believed to be state-controlled and active since 2011, targeted Russian military-industrial companies in November 2023. The group used phishing emails to masquerade as a research institute specializing in nuclear weapons design. XDSpy has a history of targeting strategic organizations in Eastern Europe, with limited evidence of attacks on Russia due to foreign cybersecurity firms exiting the country. Despite not having a sophisticated toolkit, XDSpy focuses on operational security and obfuscation of implants to evade detection. Recent reports also highlight cyberattacks on Russian banks, telecom operators, logistics, and tech companies by other hacker groups like DarkWatchman, Hellhounds, and Rare Wolf. The majority of state-sponsored cyberattacks against Russia are believed to originate from North Korea and China, with a focus on data theft.
