Summary:
Operation BugDrop, also known as CyberX, is a large-scale cyber-reconnaissance operation targeting victims in Ukraine since 2016. The threat actor remotely controls PC microphones to eavesdrop on sensitive conversations and uses Dropbox to store exfiltrated data. At least 70 victims in critical infrastructure, media, and scientific research sectors have been successfully targeted. The operation aims to capture audio recordings, screenshots, documents, and passwords. The threat actor's capability to bypass camera tape blocks by targeting microphones makes it difficult to defend against. The sponsor is motivated by information theft and espionage, with Russia being the country of origin. The victims operate in sectors such as engineering, oil and gas, media, and research across Austria, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Ukraine. The novelty of using Dropbox for data exfiltration sets this threat actor apart. (Report last modified on 2020-04-14)
