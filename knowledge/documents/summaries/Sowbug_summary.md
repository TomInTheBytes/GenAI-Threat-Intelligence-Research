Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor known as Sowbug has been identified by Symantec as conducting highly targeted cyber espionage attacks against government entities in South America and Southeast Asia, focusing on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets. The group has been active since at least early-2015 and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei, and Malaysia. Sowbug is well-resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously, and operates outside of standard office hours to maintain a low profile. The threat actor uses novel techniques such as impersonating commonly used software packages to avoid detection and has been observed maintaining a presence on a victim's network for up to six months. Sowbug's tools include the Felismus backdoor and the Starloader loader, with specific detections in place by Symantec. The group's command and control infrastructure includes domains like nasomember[DOT]com and cosecman[DOT]com. The emergence of Sowbug serves as a reminder that no region is immune to cyber espionage threats.
