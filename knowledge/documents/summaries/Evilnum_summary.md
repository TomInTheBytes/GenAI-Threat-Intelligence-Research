Report 4

Evilnum is a threat actor first seen in 2018, targeting the financial technology sector, particularly organizations based in Israel. The group is associated with the malware family EVILNUM, a JavaScript-based malware used in attacks against similar organizations. They have been linked to information theft and espionage activities. The threat actor has targeted victims in various sectors including financial and government, operating in countries such as Albania, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Israel, Italy, UK, and Ukraine. The group has been observed using a variety of tools including Cardinal RAT, Evilnum, and PyVil RAT. Notable hacking operations include Operation "Phantom in the [Command] Shell" in May 2020 and continued activity with updated tactics and new targets in 2022. The threat actor has been active in recent years, demonstrating evolving techniques and capabilities.





Report 5

Summary:
The Evilnum APT group has returned with updated tactics, techniques, and procedures targeting victims in the FinTech sector, particularly companies dealing with trading and compliance in the UK and Europe region. The threat actor has shifted from using Windows Shortcut files to MS Office Word documents for malicious payload delivery, employing document template injection. The group has registered new domains not previously detected by security vendors, indicating their ability to evade detection. Novel techniques include VBA code stomping, obfuscated JavaScript for payload decryption, and careful naming of file system artifacts to mimic legitimate binaries. The threat actor leverages scheduled tasks for persistence and employs a loader to decrypt and execute a main backdoor, which exfiltrates data and communicates with C2 domains. The attack timeline coincided with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, showcasing the threat actor's adaptability and sophistication. The complete attack chain of this new instance of Evilnum APT group is not publicly documented as of the report date of June 27, 2022.





Report 6

Summary:
The threat actor known as Evilnum has been active since 2018, targeting mainly FinTech companies in the UK and EU regions. They have recently been observed using a new Python-scripted Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named PyVil RAT, which allows for data exfiltration, keylogging, and taking screenshots. The group's operations are highly targeted, focusing on abusing Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations to gain access to sensitive information. Evilnum has shown a capability to evolve their tactics, including using modified versions of legitimate executables and expanding their infrastructure with new domains associated with their C2 IP addresses. The group's use of new tools and techniques, such as PyVil RAT and modified executables, demonstrates their ability to innovate and adapt to avoid detection by security tools. The report does not specify a specific date or operation time window for the observed activity.
