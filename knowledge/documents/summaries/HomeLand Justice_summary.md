Report 2

Iranian state actors, identified as "HomeLand Justice," conducted cyber operations against the Government of Albania in July and September 2022. The threat actor used destructive cyber attacks, including ransomware-style file encryption and disk wiping malware, rendering websites and services unavailable. They maintained network access for approximately a year, exfiltrating email content and launching ransomware attacks in July 2022. The threat actor also posted anti-MEK messages on social media and claimed credit for the cyber attacks. In September 2022, they launched another wave of cyber attacks likely in retaliation for public attribution. The threat actor used novel techniques such as exploiting CVE-2019-0604 in Microsoft SharePoint for initial access and deploying a disk wiper tool (cl.exe) for data wiping. The FBI and CISA recommend organizations apply best practices to reduce the risk of compromise. The threat actor's capabilities and persistence demonstrate a high level of sophistication and persistence.
