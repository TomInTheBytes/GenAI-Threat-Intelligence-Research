Report 3

Summary:
The threat actor "Boson Spider" has been identified as the creator of the CoreBot malware, a new information stealer discovered by IBM Security X-Force researchers on August 28, 2015. CoreBot is a modular malware with the capability to steal passwords and personal data from various applications on infected endpoints. It uses a plugin system to easily add new theft capabilities and communicates with its command-and-control server to download plugins. CoreBot also has a domain generation algorithm (DGA) for communication with its C&C server. The malware is currently unable to intercept real-time data from web browsers but can steal saved passwords and personal data. CoreBot poses a significant risk to organizations by harvesting access credentials and confidential business data, as well as downloading and launching other malware on infected PCs. The threat actor behind CoreBot has been identified as Boson Spider, with communication domains registered by an individual based in Russia. The malware is designed to be easily updated and could evolve into a more complex threat in the future. The victims targeted by CoreBot are primarily enterprise endpoints, with a focus on stealing sensitive information for potential monetization by cybercriminals. The threat actor's use of novel techniques, such as a modular plugin system and DGA, sets CoreBot apart from traditional information stealers. The report provides detailed analysis of CoreBot's capabilities and risks, emphasizing the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to mitigate the threat posed by this new malware.
