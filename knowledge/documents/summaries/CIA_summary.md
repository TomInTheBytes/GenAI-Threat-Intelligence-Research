Report 1

Summary:
The threat actor in question is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States, a state-sponsored entity focused on information theft, espionage, sabotage, and destruction. The CIA has been involved in covert cyber operations against Iran and Russia, with a notable instance being the deployment of Stuxnet in Iran as part of Operation Olympic Games. The agency's hacking arsenal was compromised in 2017 when WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as "Vault 7." The CIA operates globally and has subgroups like Longhorn and The Lamberts. The agency's capabilities and activities have raised concerns about its ability to secure its cyber operations. The CIA's motivation is primarily focused on gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information through human intelligence. The threat actor has been active since 1947 and operates under various aliases, including the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA's activities have been linked to a more permissive environment for military cyber operations under the Trump administration.
