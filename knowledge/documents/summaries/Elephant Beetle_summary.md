Elephant Beetle, a financially motivated threat group tracked by Sygnia's Incident Response team, has been targeting organizations in the finance and commerce sector in Latin America since 2020. The group employs over 80 unique tools and scripts to execute patient, long-term attacks, primarily focusing on Java-based attacks on legacy applications running on Linux-based machines. They have been observed targeting organizations in Latin America, with incidents also reported in the U.S. The group's tactics allow them to operate undetected while extracting significant amounts of money from their victims. Elephant Beetle's capabilities and techniques, including deploying their own Java Web Application on victim machines, demonstrate a high level of sophistication. The threat actor's operations pose a significant risk to both regional and global organizations in the financial sector. (Report last modified on 2022-01-25)
