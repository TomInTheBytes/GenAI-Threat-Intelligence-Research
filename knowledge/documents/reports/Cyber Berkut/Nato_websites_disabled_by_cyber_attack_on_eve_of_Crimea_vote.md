By Peter Spiegel in Brussels Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Websites belonging to Nato and the alliance’s Estonia-based cyber defence “centre of excellence” were forced offline by a denial-of-service attack on the eve of Crimea’s independence referendum.
Oana Lungescu, the alliance’s spokeswoman, wrote in a tweet that the attack “hasn’t affected the integrity of Nato’s systems” and had “no operational impact”.
A group calling itself the Cyber Berkut claimed responsibility, saying in a statement posted on its website that it launched the attack at 6pm Saturday evening. “We, Cyber Berkut, will not allow the presence of Nato occupiers on the territory of our homeland,” the statement said in Russian. Berkut is the name of the Ukrainian riot police responsible for the crackdown on anti-Russian protesters last month in Kiev.
Ms Lungescu said the websites were brought down for “a few hours”, and the homepage of the Tallinn-based Nato Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was back up shortly after the attack was discovered. But the alliance’s www.nato.int homepage was still difficult to access on Sunday morning.
Ms Lungescu said Sunday morning that the attack was “still ongoing, but most services restored”.
A distributed denial-of-service attack occurs when hackers overload a website’s servers by flooding it with requests from multiple systems.

The Cyber Berkut statement claimed that the Nato cyber defence organisation was working with the “Kiev junta” to “conduct active propaganda”, and was blocking information on “the actions of criminals who call themselves ‘the lawful authorities’”.
“We appeal to Nato cyber-bandits: get away from Ukrainian land!” the statement said.
