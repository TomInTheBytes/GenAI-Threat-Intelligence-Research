Critical infrastructures are needed in today's modern world. The actors of cyber espionage have transformed how the world utilizes resources and has taken advantage of the cyber domain by having the advancements in technology being used for malicious activities and cyber attacks. Espionage has been occurring since the beginning of time, where world powers and countries have gone out of their way to spy on their adversaries to gather intelligence, steal information and trade secrets too. The cyber domain has changed how we access information, and the old way of executing espionage is now being performed within the cyber domain where anonymity favors the malicious actors. The significant issues regarding cyber espionage are deterrence through the infiltration of critical infrastructures, using technological (cyber) espionage to gain military knowledge and trade secrets, and industrial espionage to gain an economic advantage over their adversaries' economy. The solutions to these significant issues are not simple at all, especially when most countries take part in some form of cyber espionage. Governments and individuals need to approach this issue with caution and balance passive and proactive defensive measures. Some of the solutions consist of security information and event management (SIEM) appliances, upgrading software and computer systems, testing malicious cyber attacks in a controlled environment and educating individuals in cybersecurity. One of the significant issues of cyber espionage is deterrence through the infiltration of critical infrastructures. These types of cyber attacks on infrastructures have occurred numerous times over the last two decades and from multiple world powers. Actors use deterrence to try and push their adversaries away. The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) executed Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (ATP1) on numerous industries to locate and steal vital confidential information (McWhorter, 2013).

Introduction

It was 2004 when computer network analyst and navy-veteran Shawn Carpenter stumbled
across irregularities in the computer systems of his employer, Sandia Laboratories in New
Mexico. Earlier on in 2003, Carpenter had investigated similar a network break-in at
Lockheed Martin, the largest defense contractor in the US. Soon he realized that the
networks of his employer, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, had been breached too and that
large quantities of files containing corporate information were copied and exported to
unknown servers. Sandia Laboratories, a research and development lab overseen by the US
department of Energy, had fallen victim to a hack, carried out by a group of hackers. Over
the course of four months, Carpenter voluntary studied the hackers and worked overnight
from his home office, tracing and mapping their activity and reporting this to intelligence
handlers at the Army, who code named him Spiderman. However, as by US law it was
prohibited for Army intelligence handlers to work with US civilians, he was soon passed on to
the FBI he e Ca pe te p o ed to e esse tial to the FBI’s esea h i to the ha ki g case,
  hi h as the        ode a ed Tita Rai      1
                                                .

Both Carpenters research and the FBI investigation indicated that the affected companies
had fallen victim to cyber espionage. Hackers had secretly copied large quantities of
company files without leaving any digital fingerprints. After researching Titan Rain for a
couple of months, Carpenter discovered that the apparent end-of the trail led to three
routers in China. A few years later, the existence of Titan Rain was publicly announced and
the U“ go e        e t as ui kl to poi t out that the People’s Li e atio A my (PLA) was
their prime suspect in the hacking case2.

Until present day, the US continue to attribute the cyber espionage program to China3 and
Chinese espionage remains to be high on the agenda of cyber security specialists and
agencies4. However, the People’s Repu li of Chi a has always firmly denied any
involvement in Titan Rain, and despite Carpenters efforts in technically tracing down the
origin of the hack to the routers in China, there is no substantive proof that can support the

accusations towards the Chinese government5. Moreover, until present day, the US
government has publicly released only very little information on what they know about Titan
Rain. Therefore, the case of Titan Rain provides much ground for further analysis.

This paper delves deeper into the espionage program and will conduct a multidimensional
and in-depth analysts of Titan Rain along the outline of the targeting model for cyber
operations, which has been conceptualized by Ducheine and Van Haaster6. All individual
components of and cyber operation that can be related to their model, which are the
(strategic) objectives of the attacker, actors involved, means and methods applied,
addressees, consequences and lessons learned, will be analyzed and critically assessed.
However, in order to enhance readability of the analysis, this paper will slightly divert from
the sequential order of Ducheine and Van Haaster’s model by starting with an analysis of
the Technical Tools and Practices (TTPs) of the Titan Rain hackers. Then, the technical
findings will be connected to the plausible (strategic) objectives of Titan Rain and the
potential actors involved will be identified. Third, the direct and indirect effects of Titan Rain
will be analyzed and related to the previously identified strategic objectives of the
perpetrators. Fourth, this paper will briefly address the lessons learned from Titan Rain and
will make an argument for the adoption of cyber counterintelligence methods in countering
threats similar to Titan Rain rather than seeking just technical solutions. Finally, in a short
conclusion the main findings of this paper will be summarized.

Technical anatomy of the intrusions

The Titan Rain cyber espionage activities took place –for what is certain- between 2003 and
2006. However, due to the fact that at present day still very little is known about the true
identity of the actors who constituted Titan Rain, it is possible that Titan Rain is still active as
similar intrusions continue to be discovered until present day7. Moreover, Titan Rain is
regarded one of the first Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in the digital era8. When we
    o pa e the ope atio al Te h i ues Ta ti s a d P o edu es TTP’s employed by Titan Rain
to the cycle of operations for APT, as conceptualized by Shakarian et al, we can distill that
from a technical point of view the modus operandi of Titan Rain fit the ATP classification.

Operational TTPs of Titan Rain: APT

There are many variations to the conceptual cycle for APT of Shakarian et al, but the core
principles of such alternative models remain the same9. First, a hacker or collective of
hackers perform reconnaissance or intelligence gathering in order to identify vulnerabilities
in the target’s system. They do so by scanning, though enumeration of target networks and
through social engineering. Common practice in this stage of a hack is to insert a Trojan
Ho se i to the ta get’s s ste . “u se ue tl , the ha ke                a e ploit this e t   to the s stem
and gain further access to steal or modify data. Then, the hacker makes sure he maintains
pe siste e          e ai i g u dete ted o the ta get’s s ste             i o de to olle t la ge
amounts of information over a long period of time. Finally, the stolen data is being analyzed,
put to use and additional systems to target are being identified10. In his volunteering job as
FBI informant on Titan Rain, Carpenter discovered that Titan Rain was able to commandeer
hidden sections of hard drives while maintaining a low profile. The Titan Rain hackers zipped
up many files and transported the copied data to stations in South Korea, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, while simultaneously wiping all traces of their presence, and installing an almost
undetectable beacon which allowed them re-enter the device in a later stage11. This
indicated that Titan Rain had the intention to maintain persistence and gather data over a
relatively long time span. Moreover, Titan Rain further exploited their initial hack into the

systems of Lockheed Martin               gai i g a ess to the s ste s of Lo kheed’s subsidiary,
Sandia Laboratories. Therefore, the operational set-up of Titan Rain fits well with the
concept of APT.

Tactical TTPs of Titan Rain: MyFip
Delving deeper into current understanding of the tactical TTPs of Titan Rain, and on what is
publicly known about the Trojan Horse or other type of malware that the hackers have used
to gain access, it becomes clear that in publicly available reports, much remains unknown.
What has become clear first by public research on Titan Rain is that it was an outsider attack,
meaning that the attack stems from outside the sphere of the affected parties12. In current
literature, no confirmation can be found on the exact technical tools used by the hackers.
However, there is one computer worm that has been named as the potential tool that Titan
Rain has used to infiltrate the US based computers. The worm was discovered in 2004,
approximately a year after Titan Rain had started operating and has been identified as
 MyFip : malware that is designed to exploit holes in Windows XP. According to TechTarget,
MyFip can pose a substantial threat if the malware is focused properly13. Significant to this
specific worm was that it sought though computers and client machines for .pdf, .doc and
CAD/CAM files, which are often files in which companies store their intellectual property 14.
When the worm stumbled across such a file on a device, the file was immediately
transmitted to an IP address located in China15. A single attack, in which a computer was
fully screened and data transmitted, took just about 10 to 30 minutes16. It is plausible that
this specific malware has accidently been hauled in as a Trojan Horse via spam by an
employee at the one of affected companies17.


However, in a report on MyFip, which has been issued by LURHQ, the worm is described as
not a highly sophisticated tool. Researchers identified imperfections and noted that it would
not take much skill and social engineering to construct and employ this malware. This stands
in contrast with the observations made by Shawn Carpenter.

Carpenters investigation indicates that there might be more sophistication to the Titan Rain
hackers than the technical research on the plausible connection between MyFip and Titan
Rain has revealed. As he points out, the people behind Titan Rain were cautious and well
organized. Carpenter estimates that the devices connected to the three prime routers were
staffed 24/7 and that Titan Rain made sure it left no digital fingerprints behind 18. The report
on MyFip however, argues that users of the malware cared very little about leaving trails
behind19, which stands in sharp contrast with Carpenters argument that Titan Rain left no
traces. Due to the very limited amount of sources it is hard to find indefinite proof for the
connection between Titan Rain and Myfip.

Strategic objectives, power & attribution

The available technical knowledge on the Titan Rain aides in finding plausible objectives of
the perpetrators. What is clear is that Titan Rain has passed on large quantities of files
belonging to US based defense contractors. Carpenter was able to save a copy of the
transported files and noted that these files contained templates and information on military
and aerospace hardware. He argued that the digital spies had no interest in harming any
systems or damaging the company which they attacked with their malware; they just
wanted to establish a sustainable connection with the devices of interest in order to
systematically snoop on the designs, reports and technical data produced by the defense
contractors20. Therefore it is safe to presume that their interests laid in the content rather
than the system they intruded. The objective of the Titan Rain intrusions therefore probably
lies in gaining a strategic advantage with regard to industrial design of military and
aerospace hardware.

The previous paragraph described how Carpenter studied the digital transfers of the stolen
data. Carpenter identified three routers as the primary access points of Titan Rain to the
internet and found their apparent location to be in the province of Guangdong, China 21.
Another technical argument that supports the suspicion towards China is that the origins of
the MyFip worm, the malware that is continued to be associated with Titan Rain and other
cyber espionage activities, have also been traced back to China22. An attachment of a MyFip
spam mail revealed a MIME boundary tag that which has frequently been used by Chinese
cyber spies.

Chinese strategic interests and objectives

However, the most difficult thing with Titan Rain is, as is with most cyber operations, the
problem with attribution: determining who the creator of a cyber operation is and where it
exactly originated23. Therefore, we must delve deeper into the objectives and plausible
strategic interests of China in order to establish more ground for the allegations against the
Chinese government in the case of Titan Rain.

First, it must be noted that at the time that Titan Rain was active, China had many political
and economic motivations for industrial espionage24. While in 2002, Chi a’s white paper
on National Defence mainly articulated some revised national defence policies25, the 2004
white paper marked a paradigm shift towards military revolution: a revolution in Military
Affairs with Chinese Characteristics26 . Part of this new strategy was the acceleration of the
modernization of Chinese weaponry and equipment. This aspired military revolution and
Chinese competition with the US hegemony are factors that can explain the practice of
industrial espionage on the US.

Second, just a few years before Titan Rain, in 1999, two Chinese PLA Colonels wrote a
revolutionary book which already articulated the first signs of these Chinese aspirations. The
book not only focused on shift in Chinese military thought, but also on the wider strategic
implications of ICT that became apparent to Chinese military leaders in the late 90ies. It was
already in this book that the heavy military dependence of the US on ICT networked systems
was identified by Chinese strategists. Moreover, Qiao and Xiangsui, argued that China could
exploit this major vulnerability to gain an asymmetric advantage27. In line with the classical
military thought of Sun Tzu, China could then win a war without bloodshed by adopting
asymmetric methods to defeat the superior. Computer network attacks fit well within the
concept of asymmetric methods that the PLA can employ relatively easy against the US in
order to gain strategic advantage28.

When examining the 2004 white paper on National Defense, it can be deduced that these
thoughts have been translated to policy goals as the paper states that the Chinese military
aims at the construction of an informationalized force, capable of winning an information
war29. The Titan Rain espionage program fits well within this Chinese military paradigm shift.

By conducting Titan Rain, China possibly pursued to expand its military power and has tried
to do so by engaging in an asymmetrical operation, a cyber operation. However, even
though the PLA was able to convey its compulsory cyber power, meaning the power to hold
control of machines or networks by deploying non-material resources to coerce the

adversary30, it did not take full advantage of this power with Titan Rain as it sole interest was
to steal sensitive data rather than to coerce or damage the US. Rather, the operation
targeted the conceptual and moral components of the US fighting power, which will be
addressed further on in this paper.

Actors

Taking in regard the level of sophistication and the wide scope of the attacks, it is most likely
that Titan Rain is a collective rather than individual hackers. The few experts that
commented on the subject matter argued that the espionage activities and malware
installment must have been a carefully orchestrated attack31 and it is therefore very unlikely
that a olle ti e of s ipt kiddies     ould have been behind it. The Information Systems Audit
and Control Association (ISACA) designed a model that connects the level of sophistication of
attackers (script kiddies, criminal hackers, insiders and the state) to the most likely
objectives behind a cyber operation or hack. The prime interest of criminal hackers is to earn
money, whereas insiders often seek to find personal gain from an attack32. According to the
model, only script kiddies and state actors are potentially interested in orchestrated
espionage, but script kiddies, who would carry out an attack out of experimentation, would
not have the much needed resources and capacity to maintain an APT such as Titan Rain.
Therefore, the actors behind Titan Rain were most likely either the state or state-sponsored.

Shortly after Titan Rain gained public notice in 2005, the director of the SANS institute, Allen
Paller, stated that according to his research, the hacking group most likely consists of very
disciplined individuals and that no other organization than a military organization would be
capable of orchestrating such a cyber espionage program33. The US government adopted his
argument and was o i ed that the People’s Li e atio A               PLA    as behind Titan
Rain34. Not much later on, in 2007, several intrusions that were remarkably akin to those of
Titan Rain were attributed to the PLA as well by the US government35. Unfortunately, until
present day neither the US, nor private investigators have disclosed any further information

o e ide e suppo ti g the U“ go e         e t’s claim. Therefore, again, there is no real
evidence that the PLA was behind Titan Rain or the other reported intrusions.

Alternative theories

Moreover, the US government has been wrong about attributing an attack to the PLA
before. In 1998, when an attack was launched against Pentagon computers, several officers
within the Department of Defense already contemplated issuing a counterstrike against a
perceived Chinese perpetrator, until a few days later, further investigation attributed the
attack to a group of teenage hackers from California36. With regard to Titan Rain, Lewis
argues in his work that China, who was even at that time a sophisticated opponent to the
US, would launch a cyber-attack from a third country. He regards it very unlikely that the
Chinese intelligence services would make the mistake to leave a trail and digital footprints
behind. Moreover, China had the diplomatic and economic leverage to ensure it can pursue
its activities in communication facilities elsewhere in the world37. So if the perpetrator of the
Titan Rain would be the Chinese government or PLA, it would be very unlikely that the digital
trail leads back to mainland China.

Another alternative theory holds that China itself has been exploited by a third country. In
the early 2000nds, Chinese networks were extremely vulnerable and it was relatively easy
for hackers to exploit Chinese computers for criminal or other purposes38. Nevertheless,
when looking back to the time when Titan Rain was discovered, and taking in regard the
strategic interests of China in the early 2000nds, the fact that China has a documented
history of spying39, and the fact that China had the organizational capacity and technical
expertise needed to run APTs40, the scenario of industrial espionage orchestrated by the
Chinese government, and possibly carried out by the PLA, is much more plausible than these
alternative cases.

Consequences

The revelation of the existence of Titan Rain was quite revolutionary in the early 2000nds as
it was the first time that the concept of cyber espionage was publicly introduced 41. However,
the direct consequences for the addressees, the affected national labs and defense
contractors, were relatively benign.

Direct consequences

Besides the previously mentioned Lockheed Martin and Sandia laboratories, the NASA and
Redstone Military Arsenal, a census-designated place of the US army where several missile
manufacturing facilities, laboratories and test ranges are located, also fell victim to Titan
Rain. Amongst the thousands of stolen documents were hundreds of detailed schematics of
parts of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, specs for mission planning systems of Army
helicopters and flight planning software42. This means that Titan Rain was especially
designed to target the content layer in cyber space.

In his work, Klimburg identifies four layers of cyberspace; a physical, a logical, a content and
a social layer, which in theory can all be potentially targeted in a cyber operation43.
However, Titan Rain only targeted the content layer; the layer in which information is being
captured, stored and processed within cyberspace44. The end result of the operation is that
intellectual property has been stolen, which has very limited impact on the other layers of
cyber space as no systems are being damaged or individual persona have been harmed. But
in the long term, the attack on the content layer might just be enough to provide the
adversary with the strategic advantage of having insight in the capabilities and development
of weaponry of the addressee.

What can be deduced from this is that with Titan Rain and the theft of intellectual property,
the PLA has been able to employ its conceptual component of its military capabilities,
meaning the intellectual basis and theoretical foundation for its military operations and
principles underpinning the approach to military their activity,45 to shape their strategic

advantage. Titan Rain harmed mainly the conceptual and morel components of US fighting
power, meaning the devaluation of the US strategic advantage and harm by the growing fear
of Chinese cyber capabilities and renewed Chinese assertiveness. However, an espionage
operation like Titan Rain can in theory also harm the physical component of the military
capabilities of the US in the long term, as the theft of these templates devalues their
technological advantage.

Key to the assessment of the significance of the stolen templates and schematics is the level
of classification that has been attributed to these documents. Though several sources argue
that the stolen data was unclassified46, there are also indications that the files were
strategically important enough to the US to require special governmental licenses for
exportation47. Accordingly, some government officials worried that even seemingly
insignificant pieces of information might allow the enemy to constitute a valuable picture of
the strengths and weakness of the US 48. This thus means that there is debate on the
strategic importance of the stolen data, but there are indications that the theft of this
intellectual property was indeed devaluating the technological strategic advantage of the US.

Indirect consequences

Except for the fact that Titan Rain provided a wake-up call to the US government, and the
notion that the operation is now regarded as one of the most severe cyber-attacks of all
time49, not much is clear about further consequences that can directly be attributed to the
Titan Rain attacks. For example, there are no sources that report if and how Titan Rain has
been able to use the content of the stolen data to its benefit. However, Titan Rain has also
had indirect consequences. The most upfront indirect consequences were diplomatic
tensions and friction between China and the US that prevailed in 2005. With very few
evidence to support their claims, the US were quickly to blame China for the intrusions50.

China has ever since refused any cooperation of investigation into the hacking51.

Lessons learned and countermeasures

There are many lessons to be drawn from Titan Rain. This paragraph will address some
important lessons learned and will address the concept of cyber counterintelligence as a
pote tial tool i       ou te i g APT’s su h as Tita Rai .

After Titan Rain

Shortly after Titan Rain, the affected parties, such as Lockheed Martin, swiftly geared up
their cyber security capacity and continue to do so by investing in cyber research and
developing organizational cyber security doctrines52. A lesson learned for Lockheed Martin
and Sandia laboratories was that there were much vulnerabilities in their unclassified
systems and that even theft of their unclassified data can potentially harm national interests.
Moreover, Titan Rain also provided the lesson that an APT can often lead to collateral
damage to partner organizations or to its subsidiaries, such as Sandia Laboratories53. A cyber
threat thus can have wide tentacles, affecting associated parties as well.

Following Titan Rain, the concept of APT is now on the radar of every cyber security
specialist. Many companies nowadays allocate a substantive amount of their security budget
to technologies providing APT solutions. However, whether these solutions, such as
purchasing anti-virus, sandbox, next level firewall software, or implementing Incident
Response Services (IRS) are adequate enough to counter APTs, remains doubtful54. What
has to be put up front is that when dealing with an APT like Titan Rain, one deals with a
human enemy, not just software.

Potential of cyber counter-intelligence

Therefore, one should invest on people, not just software55. When an actor or entity
affected by cyber espionage arms ups his digital security by investing heavily in new
capabilities, he becomes at risk of entering a digital arms race with the people behind the
APT. A digital arms race in undesirable, costly and does not mitigate the risk of falling victim
to a new attack as it is al ost i possi le to keep e e      hole i o e’s digital se u it

Studying the enemy was exactly what Shawn Carpenter did when he traced down the Titan
Rain hackers. If there is one lesson to be learned from his contribution to the investigation
into the cyber-attacks, it is that his early performance of cyber-counterintelligence was very
useful and quite revolutionary for that time. Not only was he the first person ever to digitally
chase the attackers behind an APT, he was able to perform counterintelligence on Titan Rain
by implementing a bugging code in the main Titan Rain router that sent him an e-mail alert
every time the router became active. Soon his mailbox was stuffed with evidence and
information about the moves and steps of the Titan Rain hackers which he could then hand
over to his intelligence handlers at the FBI58. Carpenters work was definitely very beneficial
to the FBI investigation into Titan Rain59 and if his efforts were to be combined with other
counter-intelligence activities, such as offensive intelligence collection and extensive
information exchange between international partners60, an APT like Titan Rain might be
averted or repelled. Therefore, in order to protect against APTs, organizations of strategic
interest such as Lockheed Martin, Redstone, NASA or Sandia Laboratories, should be
provided with the means to either perform cyber counterintelligence on their own or to buy-
in these capacities.

Conclusion

This paper has attempted to provide a thorough analysis of all the components of the Titan
Rain operation by assessing the debates on attribution, objectives and consequences of the
cyber-attacks. Moreover, it has reviewed current technical understanding of Titan Rain and
has provided the argumentation why Titan Rain fits the APT profile. With regard to
attribution of Titan Rain, the conclusion should be drawn that all evidence and theoretical
deductions are in support of the US government claim that China has the Chinese
government or PLA was behind Titan Rain. The combination of the technical arguments the
identification of potential strategic interest of China in the early 2000nds and the fact that
through technological and conceptual development current espionage activities continue to
be connected to China all supports this suspicion. But even though the direct consequences
of the cyber espionage operation seem benign at first sight, in the long term the theft of
intellectual property can have more of an impact. Therefore, cyber security experts should
continue to develop means to counter APTs and foreign hacking practices. In countering
APTs, cyber counterintelligence holds much potential as it could provide insight into the
intentions and capabilities of an adversary.

Apart from that, scholarly analysis of cyber operations can potentially contribute to
understanding new and old cyber threats. Taking in regard that it has been more than 10
years since Titan Rain was discovered, it is unfortunate that still very little research on the
operation has been conducted. This could be partially be due to the US government
remaining silent on the case, potentially over diplomatic or security reasons. Therefore,
there is much potential for public research on Titan Rain as it a fascinating case that has
shaped the o ld’s u de sta di g of APT’s,         e espio age a d suspi io to a ds Chi a’s
military development.
