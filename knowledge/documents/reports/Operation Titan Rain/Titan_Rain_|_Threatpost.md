Hacks
against the Defense Department and other U.S. agencies stretching back to 2003
were codenamed Titan Rain by investigators. The attacks, which breached
hundreds of networks, including Departments of State, Energy and Homeland
Security, were coordinated from Chinese computers, investigators found.

hundreds of networks, including Departments of State, Energy and Homeland
Security, were coordinated from Chinese computers, investigators found. Global
defense contractor Lockheed Martin and NASA were also struck in what many
experts called an attempt to glean information on U.S. systems.  While it’s usually difficult to locate the
country of origin for such attacks, researchers were able to trace them back to
the Chinese province of Guangdong. However, the individuals behind the operation
remain a mystery to this day.
