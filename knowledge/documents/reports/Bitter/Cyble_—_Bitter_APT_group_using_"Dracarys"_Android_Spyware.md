APK Ransomware, Cybercrime, Malware 










										August 9, 2022					






Bitter APT group using “Dracarys” Android Spyware 



			Cyble analyzes the Bitter APT group leveraging trojanized Messaging Apps to deliver Dracarys Android Malware.		







 








Android Malware Disguised as a Messaging Application

During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across an article wherein the researchers mentioned Bitter APT delivering the Android Spyware “Dracarys.” Bitter aka T-APT-17 is a well-known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group active since 2013 and operates in South Asia. It has been observed targeting China, India, Pakistan, and other countries in South Asia.
The Bitter APT is actively involved in both desktop and mobile malware campaigns and uses techniques like spear phishing emails, exploiting known vulnerabilities to deliver Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and other malware families.



Dracarys Android Spyware impersonates genuine applications such as Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and other chat applications and distributes through phishing sites.
During analysis, we observed that one of the phishing sites is still live and distributing Dracarys. The phishing site mimics the genuine Signal site and delivers a trojanized Signal app.

Figure 1 – Phishing site which distributes Dracarys malware

Upon in-depth analysis of the malware, we observed that the Threat Actor (TA) had inserted the malicious code into the Signal app source code to avoid being detected. The below image showcases the extra added spyware module “org.zcode.dracarys” in the trojanized version of the Signal App.

Technical Analysis

APK Metadata Information   

App Name: SignalPackage Name: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.appSHA256 Hash: d16a9b41a1617711d28eb52b89111b2ebdc25d26fa28348a115d04560a9f1003
   
Figure 3 shows the metadata information of the application.  
Figure 3 – App Metadata Information 

Manifest Description  
The malicious application mentions 24 permissions, of which the TA exploits 10. The harmful permissions requested by the malware are:  
Permission  Description READ_CONTACTSAccess phone contactsRECEIVE_SMSAllows an application to receive SMS messagesREAD_SMSAccess phone messagesCAMERARequired to access the camera device.READ_CALL_LOGAccess phone call logsREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGEAllows the app to read the contents of the device’s external storageRECORD_AUDIOAllows the app to record audio with the microphone, which the attackers can misuseWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGEAllows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of the deviceCALL_PHONEAllows an application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the callACCESS_FINE_LOCATIONAllows an app to access precise location
Source Code Review  

The trojanized version of the Signal application has registered the Accessibility Service in the Manifest file. The malware abuses the Accessibility permissions
such as auto granting permission to run the application in the background, activating Device Admin, and performing auto clicks.
Figure 4 – Malware abusing Accessibility Service

The malware connects to the Firebase server and receives the commands to execute operations for collecting the data from the victim’s device, as shown in the below image.
Figure 5 – Receiving commands from the Firebase server

The malware collects all the contacts from the infected device and sends them to the Command and Control (C&C) server “hxxps://signal-premium-app[.]org“.
Figure 6 – Malware sending contact list to the C&C server

Similarly, the malware collects SMS data, call logs, installed applications list, and files present on the infected device after receiving a command from the C&C server, as shown in Figures 7 through 10.

Figure 8 – Collecting installed application list

Figure 9 – Collecting SMS list from an infected device

Figure 10 – Collecting files present in the victim’s device

The malware registers the “DracarysReceiver” broadcast receiver, which receives the event from the Firebase server and starts collecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data from the infected device, as shown below.

The malware can capture screenshots and record audio to spy on the victim’s device. The below figure shows the code used by the malware to send captured screenshots and recordings to its C&C server.

The image below shows the C&C server and the URL path to which the stolen data is sent.

Conclusion 

According to our research, the TA has injected malicious code into genuine messaging applications such as Signal. The TA also distributed the malware through a phishing site masquerading as a genuine website that tricks users into downloading a trojanized version of popular messaging applications.
We have observed Bitter APT continuously attacking South Asian countries and changing its mode of attack with each new campaign. In this campaign, Bitter APT used a sophisticated phishing attack to infect devices with Dracarys Android Spyware.
In the coming days, we may observe a change in the Bitter APT group’s activities, with different malware variants, enhanced techniques, and distribution modes.
Our Recommendations 

We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:   
How to prevent malware infection? 
Download and install software only from official app stores like Play Store or the iOS App Store. Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as PCs, laptops, and mobile devices. Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile device where possible. Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone. Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices. Be careful while enabling any permissions. Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated. 
How to identify whether you are infected? 
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices. Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions accordingly. 
What to do when you are infected? 
Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the Mobile Data. Perform a factory reset. Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible. Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset. 
What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction? 
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank. 
What should banks do to protect their customers? 
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from malware attacks via telephone, SMS, or emails.
