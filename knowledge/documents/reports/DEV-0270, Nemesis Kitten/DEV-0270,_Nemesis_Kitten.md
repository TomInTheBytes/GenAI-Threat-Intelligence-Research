## Threat actor aliases

DEV-0270 (Microsoft), Nemesis Kitten (CrowdStrike), DireFate (BAE Systems)

## Description

A subgroup of {{Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Illusion, Charming Kitten}}.

(Microsoft) Microsoft threat intelligence teams have been tracking multiple ransomware campaigns and have tied these attacks to DEV-0270, also known as Nemesis Kitten, a sub-group of Iranian actor PHOSPHORUS. Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that DEV-0270 conducts malicious network operations, including widespread vulnerability scanning, on behalf of the government of Iran. However, judging from their geographic and sectoral targeting, which often lacked a strategic value for the regime, we assess with low confidence that some of DEV-0270â€™s ransomware attacks are a form of moonlighting for personal or company-specific revenue generation.
