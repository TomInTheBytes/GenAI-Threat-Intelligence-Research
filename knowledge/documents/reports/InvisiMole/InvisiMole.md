# Threat actor: InvisiMole

**UUID**: 21785caa-d383-454d-a0cb-4242e57d0f8e

**First seen**: 2013

**Source last modified**: 2022-04-08

## Threat actor aliases

InvisiMole (ESET), UAC-0035 (CERT-UA)

## Description

(ESET) This is the modus operandi of the two malicious components of InvisiMole. They turn the affected computer into a video camera, letting the attackers see and hear what’s going on in the victim’s office or wherever their device may be. Uninvited, InvisiMole’s operators access the system, closely monitoring the victim’s activities and stealing the victim’s secrets.

Our telemetry indicates that the malicious actors behind this malware have been active at least since 2013, yet the cyber-espionage tool was never analyzed nor detected until discovered by ESET products on compromised computers in Ukraine and Russia.

The campaign is highly targeted – no wonder the malware has a low infection ratio, with only a few dozen computers being affected.

ESET also found that InvisiMole targeted computers already compromised by {{Gamaredon Group}}.
