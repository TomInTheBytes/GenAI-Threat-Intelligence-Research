## Threat actor aliases

ShinyHunters (self given)

## Description

(ZeroFOX) ShinyHunters is taking a page out of the book of {{Gnosticplayers}}, the breach data broker who in 2018-2019 pilfered billions of records from dozens of companies and sold them online. Due to the verification of the Tokopedia breach by multiple researchers and the company itself, ZeroFOX Alpha Team has HIGH confidence that these new breaches are legitimate, and will most likely be available on other breach marketplaces at lower prices in the near future. It is likely that this actor will continue to breach companies and post their content for sale. These tactics proved both successful and profitable for gnosticplayers, and it is likely they will continue to appeal to other breach brokers for these reasons.
