## Threat actor aliases

Rancor (Palo Alto), Rancor Group (Palo Alto)

## Description

(Palo Alto) Throughout 2017 and 2018 Unit 42 has been tracking and observing a series of highly targeted attacks focused in South East Asia, building on our research into the KHRAT Trojan. Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes.

We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it “Rancor”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit.

Kaspersky found connections between this group and {{DragonOK}}.
