## Threat actor aliases

Operation Bandidos (ESET)

## Description

(ESET) In 2021 we detected an ongoing campaign targeting corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, with 90% of the detections in Venezuela. When comparing the malware used in this campaign with what was previously documented, we found new functionality and changes to this malware, known as Bandook. We also found that this campaign targeting Venezuela, despite being active since at least 2015, has somehow remained undocumented. Given the malware used and the targeted locale, we chose to name this campaign Bandidos.
