"We have taken precautions to defeat the targeted attack," Ms Pilorge told the ABC.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the attack attempts were still happening for Licadho staff."In this instance we're pretty confident that this is being carried out by a group we track as APT32," said Ben Wilson, a Canberra-based threat intelligence analyst with cyber security firm FireEye. "They are what we believe to be a Vietnam-based nation state group that are acting in the interests of Vietnam's political interests," Mr Wilson told the ABC.  First the attack tricks users into providing their Google account data.(ABC News) Then it asks whether you will allow GTransfer access to your Google account.(ABC News)APT32 has targeted foreign governments, as well as Vietnamese dissidents and journalists for at least five years. Since 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam's manufacturing, consumer products and hospitality sectors. This particular malware campaign by APT32 is believed to have started in late 2016 and is the first state-linked hacking outfit identified by FireEye that is not Chinese or Russian."This kind of selective targeting allows the actors to stay under the radar a bit longer, you're less likely to tip off someone [than] if they're just redirecting all visitors to these websites to a malicious location," said Mr Wilson.FireEye first detected the Phnom Penh Post had been compromised in November 2017.Using Wayback Machine — a research tool that allows a snapshot of webpages as they existed on certain dates — it is clear that malicious 'eval()' code used to trigger the targeted attack was added to the Phnom Penh Post website on or around May 8.Malware attack comes ahead of national electionCalls to six different numbers listed on the Phnom Penh Post website went unanswered on Tuesday.The ABC has contacted Sivakumar Ganapathy via his company Asia PR, and his lawyer Ly Tayseng, but there was no response at time of publication.

In a New York Times story about cyber-attacks in Asia and Europe, spokeswoman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Le Thi Thu Hang called the findings of a previous FireEye report "groundless". Vietnam "does not allow cyberattacks on organisations or individuals," she told the New York Times in May 2017.Australian security researcher Troy Hunt said getting access to email is particularly valuable for hackers."It tends to be the skeleton key for all your other accounts, so if someone can get access to your email they usually have the ability to go through and reset passwords on other accounts," said Mr Hunt. He said there were some obvious warning signs that GTransfer was bogus, including its website having the contact the email "some.email@somewhere.com"."It certainly looks dodgy," said Mr Hunt.The malware attack comes in the lead-up to a national election in Cambodia on 29 July.Hun Sen — who was placed into power by Vietnam in the 1980s and has been Prime Minister for 33 years — has threatened civil war if his Cambodian People's Party is not re-elected.On Hun Sen's request, courts have outlawed the main opposition party, locked up its leader on treason charges and banned 118 opposition MPs from politics for five years. The increasingly-authoritarian leader has also attacked the media.Both the Phnom Penh Post and The Cambodia Daily were hit with multi-million-dollar tax bills. The Daily was forced to close last year, and the Post's sale earlier this month was immediately followed by editorial interference by the new Malaysian owner and the departure of 14 staff. Crucially, for Cambodia's mostly-rural population with low literacy, Hun Sen closed down 32 radio frequencies which broadcast independent news.Disclosure: Liam Cochrane worked at the Phnom Penh Post as a journalist in 2004 and as the managing editor in 2005.Posted 15 May 201815 May 2018Tue 15 May 2018 at 7:09am, updated 15 May 201815 May 2018Tue 15 May 2018 at 7:28amShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesCambodia's last independent newspaper sold to Malaysian 'covert' spin doctorCEO and five staff quit Cambodia's last independent newspaper over interferenceMore on:CambodiaComputer ScienceCyber CrimePrint MediaScience and TechnologyWorld PoliticsTop StoriesPoliticians call for changes to 'unfair' HECS repayment systemAnalysis by Annabel CrabbAlbanese finds a Stage 3 commitment he can keepIsrael raids main hospital in Gaza as concerns grow over planned offensive in RafahAt least six banks affected by network outages, with payments, transfers and account access hitAlbanese follows Ardern down the aisle, revealing the challenge of keeping love and politics separateUkrainian torture victim says Russian interrogators were 'non-human'Alyssa Healy falls for 99 after digging Australia out of trouble on day one against South AfricaSpaceX launches Intuitive Machines' lunar craft in latest attempt for first successful commercial Moon landingPremier fears hundreds of sites across Sydney contaminated with asbestos, maybe including homesWhat does Prabowo Subianto winning Indonesia's presidential election mean for Indonesians in Australia?PM says no plan to change treatment of family home for aged care assets test'Hang your head in shame': Click-and-collect crook sentenced for stealing car with baby insideEducation bureaucrats apologise for 'restaurant rorts''The rental property sector in Australia is not a net taxpayer'.
