## Threat actor aliases

Clever Kitten (CrowdStrike), Group 41 (Talos)

## Description

(CrowdStrike) Clever Kitten primarily targets global companies with strategic importance to countries that are contrary to Iranian interests.

Clever Kitten actors have a strong affinity for PHP server-side attacks to make access; this is relatively unique amongst targeted attackers who often favor targeting a specific individual at a specific organization using social engineering. Some attackers have moved to leveraging strategic web compromises. The reason for this is likely the availability of exploits against web browsers, which for a variety of reasons allows an attacker to bypass security features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
