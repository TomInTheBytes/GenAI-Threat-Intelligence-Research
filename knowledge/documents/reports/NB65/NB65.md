## Threat actor aliases

NB65 (self given)

## Description

(BleepingComputer) A hacking group used the Conti's ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}) leaked ransomware source code to create their own ransomware to use in cyberattacks against Russian organizations.

While it is common to hear of ransomware attacks targeting companies and encrypting data, we rarely hear about Russian organizations getting attacked similarly.

This lack of attacks is due to the general belief by Russian hackers that if they do not attack Russian interests, then the country's law enforcement would turn a blind eye toward attacks on other countries.

However, the tables have now turned, with a hacking group known as NB65 now targeting Russian organizations with ransomware attacks.
