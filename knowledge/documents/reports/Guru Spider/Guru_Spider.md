## Description

(Forcepoint) Quant is not new or a very novel piece of malware: we covered the basics of it last year when it was first advertised by its creator, MrRaiX, and began to emerge in the wild. However, analysis of the newly obtained samples quickly revealed some differences to the previously documented Quant-based Locky and Pony campaigns. Further, these newest samples all appeared to attempt to download the same payload files from the C2 server after their initial connection.
