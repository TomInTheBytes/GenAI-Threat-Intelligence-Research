## Threat actor aliases

Patchwork (Cymmetria), Dropping Elephant (Kaspersky), Chinastrats (Kaspersky), APT-C-09 (Qihoo 360), Monsoon (Forcepoint), Quilted Tiger (CrowdStrike), TG-4410 (SecureWorks), Zinc Emerson (SecureWorks), ATK 11 (Thales)

## Description

(Cymmetria) Patchwork is a targeted attack that has infected an estimated 2,500 machines since it was first observed in December 2015. There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has not observed any such activity first hand.

Patchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations.

The code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt –hence the name we’ve given the operation.

In active victim systems, Patchwork immediately searches for and uploads documents to their C&C, and only if the target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds to install a more advanced second stage malware.

This group seems to be associated with {{Confucius}}.

2018-03: Targeting US Think Tanks
In March and April 2018, Volexity identified multiple spear phishing campaigns attributed to Patchwork, an Indian APT group also known as Dropping Elephant. This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia.
