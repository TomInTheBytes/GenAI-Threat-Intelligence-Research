## Description

(Recorded Future) Recorded Future has identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group that we track as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22) targeting telecommunications, academia, research and development, and government organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and more historically, Hong Kong. In this most recent activity, the group likely used compromised GlassFish servers and Cobalt Strike in initial access operations before switching to the bespoke Winnti, ShadowPad, and Spyder backdoors for long-term access using dedicated actor-provisioned command and control infrastructure.
