## Threat actor aliases

Worok (ESET)

## Description

(ESET) ESET researchers recently found targeted attacks that used undocumented tools against various high-profile companies and local governments mostly in Asia. These attacks were conducted by a previously unknown espionage group that we have named Worok and that has been active since at least 2020. Worokâ€™s toolset includes a C++ loader CLRLoad, a PowerShell backdoor PowHeartBeat, and a C# loader PNGLoad that uses steganography to extract hidden malicious payloads from PNG files.

Activity times and toolset indicate possible ties with {{TA428}}, but we make this assessment with low confidence.
