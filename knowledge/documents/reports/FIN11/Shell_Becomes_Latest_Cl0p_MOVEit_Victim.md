MOVEit Transfer is used by a small number of Shell employees and customers. This was not a ransomware event. There is no evidence of impact to any other Shell IT systems. Our IT teams are investigating. Some personal information relating to employees of the BG Group has been accessed without authorization."Shell has not specified what kind of personal information was compromised, and it confirmed the hack only after the Cl0p cybergang published the data it allegedly stole from the company because Shell refused to negotiate.The Cl0p ransomware group has used the MOVEit managed file transfer (MFT) to steal data from hundreds of organizations, and millions have been affected by the group's actions, including at US federal government agencies.About the Author(s)Dark Reading StaffDark ReadingDark Reading is a leading cybersecurity media site.See more from Dark Reading StaffKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.
