This would involve tricking people into visiting the mimicked domains allowing the Fancy Bear group to see and steal login information that people use. As well as the two think-tanks, the domains seized were associated with several Senate offices and services. One domain sought to mimic Microsoft's Office 365 online service.Hunt wants 'malign' Russia to face actionTrump relaxes rules around cyber-attacksUS accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddlingRussia has denied Microsoft's allegations that it targeted the right-wing think-tanks. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was "unaware" of any attempted interference by Russia-linked hackers in the US mid-term elections."[Our] reaction is traditional," he told the Interfax news agency. "We are unaware what kind of hackers they refer to, we do not know what this interference entails." BBC Monitoring reported him as adding: "We do not understand whom exactly it concerns, what the evidence is and what such conclusions are based on. We have no such information."He said: "We hear confirmation from America that there was no meddling in the election."Spying chargesThe New York Times suggested that the two think tanks were targeted because they were former supporters of President Trump but were now foes who had called for more sanctions to be imposed on Russia.The International Republican Institute's directors include Senator John McCain and General HR McMaster who was replaced earlier this year as the White House national security adviser.IRI president Daniel Twining told the Times that the attacks were consistent with the "campaign of meddling" the Kremlin is known to have indulged in.Image source, CrowdstrikeImage caption, Some of Fancy Bear's activities had previously been identified by the cyber-security company CrowdstrikeIn its blog, Microsoft president Brad Smith said it had grabbed dodgy domains 12 times in two years to shut down 84 websites associated with Fancy Bear.It said that, so far, it had no evidence that the domains had been used in any attacks. The domains could have been set up to help a future planned assault.Microsoft added that the attack activity seen around the domains "mirrors" what it saw in 2016 in the US and during the 2017 election in France. Microsoft's action comes soon after the US charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking computer networks used by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.More on this storyHunt wants 'malign' Russia to face actionPublished21 August 2018Trump relaxes rules around cyber-attacksPublished16 August 2018Russian hackers' UK link revealedPublished23 November 2017US accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddlingPublished2 August 2018Top StoriesLive. Israeli special forces raid Nasser hospital in Khan YounisLive. Trump's first criminal trial set to begin next monthWhy Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seemsPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seemsHow much do Nato members spend on defence?Kansas City celebration turns to scene of chaosUkraine battles frostbite and shell shortage in ruined townWhat can Indonesia expect from a Prabowo presidency?French migration row engulfs island in Indian OceanSwatting call was an 'assassination attempt', says politicianFace to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jailKnown to fans of The 1975 as the Virgin MaryElsewhere on the BBCHow the codpiece floppedWhere it's taboo if dads don't take parental leaveThe scuzzy New York club that gave birth to punkMost Read1Why Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seems2One dead and 21 injured in Super Bowl parade shooting3Deadly strike on Russian shopping centre near border4Misconduct hearing for top prosecutor in Trump case5Tribute to black women wins at Rio Carnival parade6Spain triple murder suspect held for prison killing7'Love is a beautiful thing': Australian PM gets engaged8Lioness, Suffragette: New lines on Tube map revealed9Ukraine battles frostbite and shell shortage in ruined town10Face to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jailBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with us© 2024 BBC.
