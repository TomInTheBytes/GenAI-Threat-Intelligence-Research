## Threat actor aliases

The White Company (Cylance)

## Description

(Cylance) Cylance has determined that Operation Shaheen was an espionage campaign executed over the course of the last year. It was a targeted campaign which appeared to focus on individuals and organizations in Pakistan, specifically the government and the military. Cylance’s window into this campaign, though significant, is not all-encompassing. Indeed, our research revealed evidence that The White Company conducted extensive prior reconnaissance of its targets, and continues to operate largely unnoticed by the security community.
