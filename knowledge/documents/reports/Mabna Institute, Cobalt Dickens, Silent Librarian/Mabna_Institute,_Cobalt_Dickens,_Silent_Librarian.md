## Reported hacking operations

2018-08: Despite indictments in March 2018, the Iranian threat group is likely responsible for a large-scale campaign that targeted university credentials using the same spoofing tactics as previous attacks.
In August 2018, members of university communities worldwide may have been providing access to more than just homework assignments.
Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers discovered a URL spoofing a login page for a university.

2019-07: In July and August 2019, CTU researchers discovered a new large global phishing operation launched by COBALT DICKENS. This operation is similar to the threat group’s August 2018 campaign, using compromised university resources to send library-themed phishing emails.
