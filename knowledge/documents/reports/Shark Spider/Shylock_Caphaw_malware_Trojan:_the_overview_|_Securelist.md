Shylock/Caphaw malware Trojan: the overview

Recently Kaspersky  Lab has contributed to an alliance of law enforcement and industry organizations,  to undertake measures against the internet domains and servers that form the  core of an advanced cybercriminal infrastructure that uses the Shylock Trojan to attack  online banking systems around the globe.
Shylock is  a banking Trojan that was first discovered in 2011. It utilizes  man-in-the-browser attacks designed to pilfer banking login credentials from  the PCs of clients of a predetermined list of target organizations. Most of  these organizations are banks, located in different countries.
Kaspersky Lab  products detect the Shylock malware as Backdoor.Win32.Caphaw and  Trojan-Spy.Win32.Shylock.
We detected this  malware generically from the end of August 2011, as Backdoor.Win32.Bifrose.fly. Specific detection of this separate  family was added in February 2012. Since then we have observed a very few  detections ‚Äì approximately 24,000 attempts to infect PCs protected by Kaspersky  Lab products worldwide.
These are  very modest numbers, especially in comparison with other infamous banking  malware such as ZeuS, SpyEye, Carberp which have generated (and, in the case of  some of them, such as ZeuS , still generate) tens or hundreds of thousands of  detections. Of course, these numbers don‚Äôt tell us everything about how  widespread or effective Shylock is, because Kaspersky Lab ‚Äúsees‚Äù only a part of  the total number of PC users ‚Äì only those who use our products.
Low  popularity doesn‚Äôt make Shylock less dangerous though. The set of malicious  techniques it utilizes is no less dangerous than that used by other similar  malware. It is able to inject its body in multiple running processes, has tools  to avoid detection by anti-malware software, uses several plugins which add  additional malicious functions aimed at bypassing anti-malware software,  collects passwords for ftp-servers, spreads itself via messengers and servers,  provides remote access to the infected machine, video grabbing and of course  web injection.
This last  function is used to steal online banking credentials by injecting fake data  entry fields into the web page loaded in the victim‚Äôs browser.
During the entire  period we‚Äôve seen two relatively big peaks in detection rate for this malware.
The first  one was in November 2012 and the second one was in December 2013.

The  geography of the November 2012 peak was as follows:



United Kingdom


Italy


Poland


Russian Federation


Mexico


Thailand


Iran


Turkey


India


Spain



The table  above shows the top 10 countries wheremost attacks using the Shylock malware  were registered. A little more than a year later, in December 2013, the picture  had changed dramatically.



Brazil


Russian federation


Vietnam


Italy


Ukraine


India


United Kingdom


Belarus


Turkey


Taiwan



As these  tables show, the criminals behind this malware definitely stopped paying so  much attention to the developed e-money markets of the UK, Italy and Poland in  favor of the actively developing markets of Brazil, Russia and Vietnam. It‚Äôs  slso interesting that both peaks happened in the late autumn to early winter  period, a traditional high retail season in many countries around the world.
According  to Europol data, this malware has infected more than 30,000¬† PCs worldwide. This is a big enough scale to  cause huge financial damage, so the disruption of the Shylock backbone  infrastructure is very good news.
And even better news  is that the recent operation, coordinated by the UK‚Äôs National Crime Agency  (NCA), brought together partners from the law enforcement and the private sector,  including ‚Äì besides Kaspersky Lab ‚Äì Europol, the FBI, BAE Systems Applied  Intelligence, Dell SecureWorks and the UK‚Äôs GCHQ (Government Communications  Headquarters), to jointly combat the threat. We at Kaspersky Lab were glad to add  our modest contribution to this operation. Global action brings positive  results ‚Äì an example being the operation targeting the Shylock malware.
