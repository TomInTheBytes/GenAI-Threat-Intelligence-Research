							Threat Groups						



							Your first line of defense against adversaries
						



Powered by human intelligence, Dragos’ main threat detection method is based on analytics codified by our Threat Intelligence team. Our experts track adversary behaviors and extract their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), which are then characterized into threat analytics we use to power the Dragos Platform’s accurate threat detection capabilities.



















							What goes into tracking the world’s top Industrial Threat Groups? 						









								Dragos collects and analyzes information on cyber intrusions and attempts to compromise ICS networks 							








								We create profiles of known groups targeting ICS environments so we can focus on how they operate 							








								Finally, we establish robust analytics with comprehensive data around actions, capabilities, and intentions							










						Learn how we classify threat groups. 					

						Learn how to properly leverage the Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis to stop incidents and categorize threat activity.

						Threat Groups We’re Tracking					

The Threat Group reports below are compiled by our expert practitioners to provide awareness about your threat landscape and evolving threats, so you can create defensive plans to protect your ICS environments.
