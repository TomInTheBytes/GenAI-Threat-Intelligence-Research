Information on GovCERT




The Government Computer Emergency Response Team (GovCERT) is the national specialist service responsible for the technical management of cyberincidents and technical analysis of cyberthreats. It supports critical infrastructure operators, the public sector and the Swiss business location with technical information on current cyberthreats and with the management of cyberincidents. GovCERT also works in close collaboration with the police authorities. This cooperation covers both the exchange of information and support with technical analyses.
To ensure the timely exchange of information on cyberthreats, GovCERT works with other CERTs and CSIRTs (computer security incident response teams) worldwide. In addition, GovCERT is a member of various recognised international organisations.

List of blocked file types



GovCERT publishes a list of file types that are often used to distribute malware by email, and recommends that these be proactively blocked at the email gateway or spam filter, or placed in quarantine.

International cooperation



In the joint fight against cyberthreats, international cooperation is very important. Membership in various associations enables GovCERT to establish a global network of personal relationships. GovCERT is a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, www.first.org), of the European Government CERTs (EGC) group (www.egc-group.org) and of the International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN). In addition, GovCERT has accreditation from the European Trusted Introducer (TI) Service.
