It was once believed that when an IP or domain was outed publicly, that an actor, especially a well-resourced one, would burn it down. In this blog we’ll pull on threads to show that isn’t always the case.Sea Turtle, like most threat groups, leverages traditional malware for access, but also has used complex DNS hijacking techniques that were covered well in the above blogs. Many of the spoofed domains below would be of interest to those focused on domestic Turkish issues.This analysis will focus on four major concepts in infrastructure pivoting.Passive or Active DNS pivotingThere is no perfect answer to the question “what domains are sitting on an IP?”. Data vendors try to answer this question for analysts in a variety of ways, the most common being passive or active DNS, where the vendor collects responses for DNS requests, either by sniffing resolver traffic, by reading resolver logs, or by actively doing forward record lookups of domainsSSL certificate trackingObserving SSL certificates can often broaden a set of suspect infra, either by direct movement (seeing a cert from server A move to server B), or by tracking specific attributes of certs over time.Additionally, it would not be uncommon to see domains in certs for which you don’t have a passive/active DNS record. An actor may prep their server and add a cert before making their campaign live.Matching server response content to find similar infraFor instance, a particular HTTP response header, the fuzzy hash of body content, or the way a server responds when you throw particular data at it. Many folks scan the internet with a 5 byte ASCII string “Gh0st”, in order to see if the server they’re talking to will respond like a Gh0st RAT server.Discovering malware samples that are related to your original set, by looking for domain/ip overlaps, or by looking for static content with YARA that you don’t expect to be in many unrelated samplesWhen tracking a threat actor, an analyst develops a confidence for whether a particular indicator belongs in her dataset or not. This confidence is based on examining artifacts over time, and with an eye towards which technical links are of what quality. Servers often change ownership, ‘A’ records can be forged when a c2 isn’t operational, and supposed “uniqueness” may not be so unique upon further review. Sea Turtle leverages a multitude of these techniques which aggravate an investigationPerhaps in an effort to provide a veil of legitimacy, or to improve a general “risk score” of their domain, this actor frequently points (or parks) their domain at large cloud providers, such as amazon/akamai/google. However, when the domain is used operationally, they typically leverage dedicated providers such as BLNWX, MVPS, Choopa, or the like.Throughout their campaigns, they acquire domains (or leverage ddns) that look legitimate, such as systemctl.network, *.sslname.com, netssh.net, and serverssl.net. “serverssl” and “netssh” have nothing in common from a top level infrastructure perspective, but if you notice similar looking domains on a low density server, and see them move to IPs with the same provider, you can start to piece together lower quality sources of data.In the first pivot, we can do simple network or yara based pivot to find samples that are similar to the PWC or Greek DOJ report. The high-fidelity IoCs are collated in a github link at the end of the post, but we provide our reasoning in each table.hashextracted indicator for pivotfilename from VT01b8a91f3d4446f2bdd22c85b225dfd2f619951e8f33178c3185dbf7543845dfxss[.]codesSkype.exe01d1b63eace6383428e42c48f3d1e13e643e8a8f70d4af5d4ee6f47a0522e300xss[.]codesSkype.exe0dda7e987104867695be561a8008d3282252e05c611c247eae62c7b798be0e24139.162.137[.]240/man.php3_Members_of_the_Committee_on_National_Defence_and_Foreign_Affairs.exe13171d3b1acf5ffbae47777cae03d5d6cb96d2d9b76fe4491bf547b2e309fb52xss[.]codesSkype.exe1de46a62f53dbf3b4668bfa7fe63c022c541d8651f776fa5fd8060f21036e63a213.252.246[.]79/Chrome.exe213.252.246[.]79/main.php?s=SkypeApp.exe487bb8f6c0b6691d3575eee3faa8bfc73ddebe0d1052c02b636cc0a394ed384dupdate.qnetau[.]net/syw.php?213.252.247[.]10528fd0b183dd1ca2d109af1714d1ee89d3244c37451203b7b14e951742e16741cn.sslname[.]comSystem.exe702108f50f953aff3c2b345c2604e9fa614cb86d8299c209065b41878fd4f66bxss[.]codesSkype.exe71bbcd06a4a28f1f33a998928bfe6d78aa7a56fe068c61556f41e2586809a470xss[.]codes(potential test xlsm)85ee62d57a17221e52325020b4d6f587f68fb321723be7ed794503b40bd989f7ns2[.]me/1p.phpSkype.exe86b13a1058dd7f41742dfb192252ac9449724c5c0a675c031602bd9f36dd49b5X-Auth-43245-S-20[kauditd]94e7fff8d4abccca0080004a497153ce04f74f7507b52ca092462e22d84f0f8ans2[.]me/ip.php?s=213.252.247[.]10SkypeApp.exeaebc8acd17e247c8892e6a8226be4dbf2af3848bdcc1cc1536d1f8487bed55a4net3[.]me/man.php“hello martin”Skype.exeb0307e523e5893f2a865b0abea91cb4fb2e9d86fc71e33adaf63c8878fac2748cn.sslname[.]comSkypeApp.exebe4590c31e8385a67394f7d49147a0b97cff07da6ff771614d3d3ed9ad2cd49fns2[.]me/1p.php?s=Skype.exed7d699f04463e86abc85ec029953ea7d558fd385a5e73ce0cc0d9cd0dbebd41ecMd.eXE, “hello hgroup”d7f53836227dde351def7c1a5e9dd03c3a49bdc4eec6342136795038aa6d415dope[.]ftp[.]shxss[.]codesxlsmef1af0acb25dc88b223c7b6a6be48d35a64665bb372cf8b7674cacd5818f7ff3ns2[.]me/ip.php?s=Update.exef5e0edca8a63eb45054039104f509ef0e66fc2e67637614a0f386803506cbac1update.qnetau[.]net/syw.php?s=mpam-fe.exef8cb77919f411db6eaeea8f0c8394239ad38222fe15abc024362771f611c360fnet3[.]me/b/kddnet3[.]me/b/socatupxa.shFigure 1: Publicly available ST samplesStandalone string matches, after unpacking, remains an easy pivot to expand a dataset. Although these are not definitive pivot points, Sea Turtle does leverage a number of strange capitalizations and “shout-outs” to unknown persons, that can be combined to cast a net.Figure 2: obligatory IDA of d7d699f04463e86abc85ec029953ea7d558fd385a5e73ce0cc0d9cd0dbebd41eFigure 3: b0307e523e5893f2a865b0abea91cb4fb2e9d86fc71e33adaf63c8878fac2748In our next pivot, we’ll examine Passive/Active DNS datasets, to try to find infrastructure “one hop” away.Figure 4: PADNS coming to CARA in Q1 '24old artifactpivot pointnewnotesai-connector.splendor[.]org161.35.32[.]185ai-connector.splendos[.]orgnote “splendor->splendos”querryfiles[.]com93.115.22[.]212netssh[.]netai-connector.goldchekin[.]com168.100.10[.]187ono.technewsir[.]gqpossibly a “technews iran” spoof. however, like most pivoting these days, this is one hop away from a crypto clusterFigure 5: PADNS pivots leads to more artifactsSea Turtle has been known to spoof news-related websites, and PWC highlighted three: alhurra[.]online, al-marsad[.]co, anfturkce[.]news. Examining their infra, some of the IPs or domains throw a 426 response seen below. A 426 error is “caused when a client is attempting to upgrade a connection to a newer version of a protocol, but the server is refusing to do so.” Despite this being a valid and common response code, when scanning the internet for that header/string, only ~25 results are returned with that exact context, and many appear to be interesting.HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required

An “indicator of (potential) future attack”. An example of this is alarabiyaa[.]online, where there is no record of a forward resolution, but we can see a cert with that domain on one of our “426” IPs, 206.166.251[.]163.
