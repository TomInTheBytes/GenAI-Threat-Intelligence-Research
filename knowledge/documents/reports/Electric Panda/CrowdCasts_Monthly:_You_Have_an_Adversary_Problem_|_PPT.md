Nation-States, Hacktivists, Industrial Spies, and Organized Criminal Groups are attacking your enterprise on a daily basis. Their goals range from espionage for technology advancement and disruption of critical infrastructure to for-profit theft of trade secrets and supporting a political agenda. You no longer have a malware problem, you have an adversary problem, and you must incorporate an intelligence-driven approach to your security strategy. 
 
During this CrowdCast, you will learn how to:

    Incorporate Actionable Intelligence into your existing enterprise security infrastructure 
    Quickly understand the capabilities and artifacts of targeted attacked tradecraft 
    Gain insight into the motivations and intentions of targeted attackers
    Make informed decisions based off of specific threat intelligence

Adversaries  are humans
Targeted Attackers:

WHO ARE THE
ADVERSARIES?

Motivation can range from disruption,
theft, to even destruction
They need to get in
They will likely need to move laterally

Spray and Pray (Prey):
They don’t care who they target
(sometimes what)
The more they compromise the
more they win
Motivation can range from disruption,
theft, to even destruction
