Helix Kitten (also known as APT34 by FireEye, OILRIG, Crambus, Cobalt Gypsy, Hazel Sandstorm,[1] or EUROPIUM)[2] is a hacker group identified by CrowdStrike as Iranian.[3][4]


History[edit]
The group has reportedly been active since at least 2014.[3] It has targeted many of the same organizations as Advanced Persistent Threat 33, according to John Hultquist.[3]
In April 2019, APT34's cyber-espionage tools' source code was leaked through Telegram.[5][6]

Targets[edit]
The group has reportedly targeted organizations in the financial, energy, telecommunications, and chemical industries, as well as critical infrastructure systems.[3]

Techniques[edit]
APT34 reportedly uses Microsoft Excel macros, PowerShell-based exploits and social engineering to gain access to its targets.[3]
