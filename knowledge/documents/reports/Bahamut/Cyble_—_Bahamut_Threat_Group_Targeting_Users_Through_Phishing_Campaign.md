Bahamut Threat Group Targeting Users Through Phishing Campaign 



			A phishing campaign from a Twitter post. The Threat Actor (TA) hosts malicious Android APK files on a counterfeit version of Jamaat websites. 		







 








During Cyble’s routine threat hunting exercise, we came across a Twitter post mentioning a phishing campaign involving a Threat Actor (TA) hosting malicious Android APK files on a counterfeit version of Jamaat websites.
The phishing websites used by the TA are as follows:
jamaat-ul-islam[.]comjamatapplication[.]comjamaatforummah[.]comjamaatforallah[.]com
The figure below shows the phishing page.



 Figure 1: Phishing page to deliver malware 
As per Cyble’s research, this campaign is identical to the Bahamut group. Therefore, it is likely that the Bahamut group is operating under this alias. Bahamut is a threat group targeting the Middle East and South Asia and its attack vectors are phishing campaigns and malware. First noticed in 2017, Bahamut has targeted many individuals and entities.
Our research team has downloaded the samples and conducted a thorough analysis. Based on this, the Cyble Research Lab concluded that the malware is a variant of spyware and uploads the data to a Command & Control (C&C) server. We also observed that the malicious app disguises itself as the Jamaat chat app and the Muslim Youth app.
Technical Analysis
APK Metadata Information
App Name: JamaatChatPackage Name: com.example.jamaatSHA256 Hash: 9d4e5d46ab3e2bb4b38256960b88ddc7e266d1959fa75d676a0cac5e811ad325
 Figure 2: APK Metadata Information 
Our initial analysis observed that the TA had hosted the file with different names for the same sample.
The Bahamut malware requests the user for 21 different permissions, of which 14 are dangerous. The dangerous permissions are listed below.
Permission NameDescriptionandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTSAccess to phone contactsandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGEAccess device external storageandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGEModify device external storageandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE Access phone state and informationandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIOAllows to record audio using device microphoneandroid.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATIONFetch device location using a mobile networkandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATIONFetch device location using GPS sensorandroid.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATIONAccess location information in backgroundandroid.permission.CALL_PHONEPerform call without user interventionandroid.permission.CAMERAAccess device camera hardwareandroid.permission.READ_CALL_LOGAccess user’s call logsandroid.permission.READ_SMSAccess user’s SMSs stored in the deviceandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMSFetch and process SMS messagesandroid.permission.WRITE_SETTINGSModify device’s system settingsTable 1: Dangerous permissions 
When the user enables these permissions, the malicious app will collect information such as Contacts, SMSs, Call Logs, Audio, etc.
The below figure shows that the app requests permission at the start. 
  Figure 3: App requests permissions at the start 
The Bahamut malware requests the user for Contacts and SMS permissions upon starting the application, among others. Once the victim enables these permissions, the malware initiates background services to collect information. The below figure depicts the code to start background services for collecting data.
 Figure 4: Background service for collecting information 
The Bahamut malware creates a copy of the device’s contacts, SMS, call logs to the local database, named as tabs_database, in the initial stage. The below figure shows table details of the database.
 Figure 5: Code to create the database for storing information 
Spyware Activity
Contacts: The spyware extracts all the contacts stored on the device and stores them on a database table user_contacts. The below figure shows the code to collect contacts and store the data in a database table.
 Figure 6: Code to collect contacts data 
SMSs: As the below figure shows, the malware collects SMSs and stores it in a database table named user_sms.
 Figure 7: Code to collect SMSs 
Call Logs: As the below figure shows, the Bahamut malware extracts call log data and stores the data on a database table call_logs.
 Figure 8: Code to collect Call Logs 
Files List: A list of files from device storage is classified as documents, audio, video, images and stored in a database table named as user_filesLocation: Collects device location informationDevice Hardware details: Collectsinformation such as IMEI number, IP address, device ID, and phone model.  
The below figure depicts the code to collect device information and location.
 Figure 9: Code to collect location and device hardware information 
The malware creates listeners for users and device events, such as:
DEVICE BOOT UPSMS RECEIVEDCALL RECEIVEDWIFI STATE CHANGEUser event/New contact added
The below figure shows the code related to the listener created for CALL RECEIVED event.
 Figure 10: Code to listen for a call received event 
The Bahamut malware will upload the collected data whenever the afore-mentioned events are triggered on the victim device. The TA has also created a scheduler to upload data which will execute every 4 hours (14400000 milliseconds). The below code shows the listener for the BOOT-UP event which creates a scheduler that executes every 4 hours.
 Figure 11: Code to listen for Boot up the event and to create a scheduler 
 As the below code shows, initializeSocket() is the function that uploads all the data to the C&C server.
 Figure 12: Code used to communicate with the C&C server 
For all communication with the C&C server, the fake app uses a framework called Socket.IO, a real-time, bidirectional communication library. In addition, Bahamut malware uses HTTPS protocol to communicate with the C&C server.
C&C server URL: hxxps://h94xnghlldx6a862moj3[.]de
The below figure shows the C&C server IP, which is stored in the application code.
 Figure 13: C&C server URL in malware’s code 
The application also contains code to emulate a chat application by using the WebView functionality in Android.
Conclusion
According to our research, Bahamut frequently uses phishing pages as an attack vector to deliver malware. In this scenario, the group is targeting users trying to access Jamaat domains with Android Spyware.
To protect yourself from these infections, the user should prefer to install applications from the official Google Play Store. Also, be aware of the threat groups and their attack vectors and take measures accordingly.
Our Recommendations 
We have listed some of the essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:   
If you find this malware in your device, uninstall it immediately. Use the shared IoCs to monitor and block the malware infection. Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software. Keep your system and applications updated to the latest versions. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication. Download and install software only from registered app stores.
