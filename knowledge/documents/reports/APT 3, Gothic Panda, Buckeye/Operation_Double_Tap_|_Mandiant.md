This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.The use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors, both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits. Further, the use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is historically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.The SpearphishThe body of the message is below:One Month's Free Membership for The PLAYBOY ClUB 1080P HD VIDEOS 100,000 PHOTOS 4,000  MODELS Nude Celebrities,Playmates,Cybergirls & More!

These files have the following metadata:doc.exe (x86):MD5           492a839a3bf9c61b7065589a18c5aa8dSize          12288 bytesImport Hash   9342d18e7d315117f23db7553d59a9d1 doc.exe (x64):MD5           744a17a3bc6dbd535f568ef1e87d8b9aSize          13824 bytesCompile Time  2014-11-19 08:25:45ZImport Hash   2fab77a3ff40e4f6d9b5b7e813c618e4 test.exe:MD5           5c08957f05377004376e6a622406f9aaSize          11264 bytesCompile Time  2014-11-18 10:49:23ZImport Hash   f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744 These payload files also have interesting PDB debug strings.install.exe:    c:\Users\aa\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\MShell\Release        \MShell.pdb doc.exe:    c:\Users\aa\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\4113\Release            \4113.pdb test.exe:    C:\Users\aa\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\MyRat\Client\Client      \obj\x86\Release\Client.pdb The most interesting PDB string is the “4113.pdb,” which appears to reference CVE-2014-4113. This CVE is a local kernel vulnerability that, with successful exploitation, would give any user SYSTEM access on the machine.The malware component, test.exe, uses the Windows command "cmd.exe" /C whoami” to verify it is running with the elevated privileges of “System” and creates persistence by creating the following scheduled task:    schtasks /create /tn "mysc" /tr C:\Users\Public\test.exe /sc ONLOGON     /ru "System"When executed, the malware first establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198.103 using TCP port 1913. The malware sends the SOCKS5 connection request "05 01 00" and verifies the server response starts with "05 00". The malware then requests a connection to 192.184.60.229 on TCP port 81 using the command "05 01 00 01 c0 b8 3c e5 00 51" and verifies that the first two bytes from the server are "05 00" (c0 b8 3c e5 is the IP address and 00 51 is the port in network byte order).Once the connection to the server is established, the malware expects a message containing at least three bytes from the server. These first three bytes are the command identifier. The following commands are supported by the malware:Command IDDescription00 00 00Content after command ID is written to:C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad1.exe00 00 01Deletes the files:C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad.exeC:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe00 00 02Malware exits00 00 03Malware downloads the URL that follows the command ID. The file is saved to:C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad.exe00 00 04Content after command ID is written to:C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad2.exe00 00 05The files notepad1.exe and notepad2.exe are concatenated together and written to C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe and executed00 00 06The contents of the following file is sent to the server:C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\note.txt00 00 07The string following the command ID is executed using "cmd /C" and results are sent to server Links to APT3On October 28, we observed APT3 sending out spearphishing messages containing a compressed executable attachment. The deflated exe was a variant of the same downloader described above and connected to 198.55.115.71 over port 1913 via SOCKS5 proxy. The secondary payload in that case was detected as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter (aka Pirpi) and also named newnotepad.exe (MD5 8849538ef1c3471640230605c2623c67) and connected to the known APT3 domains:    inform.bedircati[.]com    pn.lamb-site[.]com    210.109.99.64The 192.184.60.229 IP address seen in this current campaign also hosts securitywap[.]com – another known domain referenced in our Operation Clandestine Fox blog.DOMAINFIRST SEENLAST SEENIP ADDRESSsecuritywap.com2014-11-172014-11-20192.184.60.229www.securitywap.com2014-11-172014-11-20192.184.60.229In addition, the join.playboysplus[.]com exploit and payload delivery site resolves to 104.151.248.173.This IP has hosted other domains used by APT3 in past campaigns:DOMAINFIRST SEENLAST SEENIP ADDRESSjoin.playboysplus[.]com2014-11-212014-11-21104.151.248.173walterclean[.]com2014-11-182014-11-20104.151.248.173www.walterclean[.]com2014-11-182014-11-20104.151.248.173As we discussed in our previous blog detailing previous APT3 activity, the walterclean[.]com served as a Plugx/Kaba command and control server.ConclusionAlthough APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity has demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering.Since Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that did not rely on zero-day exploits. The combination of this sustained operational tempo and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day exploit code. No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully.Here's the IOCs for this threat.  Link to RSS feedPrepare for 2024's cybersecurity landscape.Get the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Forecast 2024 report to explore the latest trends on the horizon.
