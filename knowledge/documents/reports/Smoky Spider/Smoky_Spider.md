## Threat actor aliases

Smoky Spider (CrowdStrike)

## Description

(IBM) According to 360 NetLab, the (relatively) ancient malware downloader has enjoyed a slow burn on the black market, where malicious actors can pick up a customized copy for $850. While other researchers have identified various aspects of the threat, 360 NetLab took aim at the malware’s admin panel, which offers support for multiple plugins and functions — such as FORM GRAB, BOT LIST, KEYLOGGER and more — designed to help attackers successfully infiltrate targeted devices.

The flexibility of Smoke Loader remains its biggest appeal; it was among the top 10 malware threats detected by Check Point in December 2018. It’s the first time a second-stage downloader has made the list, and may indicate a coming shift in the threat profiles of typical malware attacks.

Smoke Loader has been observed to distribute DoppelPaymer ({{Doppel Spider}}), TinyLoader ({{Tiny Spider}}), DanaBot ({{Scully Spider, TA547}}), BokBot ({{Lunar Spider}}), Zeus Panda ({{Bamboo Spider, TA544}}) and TrickBot ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}).

2019-04: Proofpoint observed that the malware returned to regular attacks against German and Swiss users in April 2019 after taking a hiatus in 2018. These campaigns helped reveal several new techniques now employed by the banking Trojan. One geographically targeted campaign against Switzerland, for instance, used an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) package to deliver Smoke Loader. This threat, in turn, downloaded Retefe two hours after infection.
