## Threat actor aliases

Salty Spider (CrowdStrike)

## Description

(CrowdStrike) The pervasiveness of Salty Spider’s attacks has resulted in a long list of victims across the globe. While it seems, for the most part, that this adversary doesn’t single out particular nations and industries, there do appear to be a few pockets where SALTY SPIDER may be more prevalent.

In 2017, SALTY SPIDER ceased propagation of traditional proxy and spambot payloads, and shifted its sights towards the mining and theft of cryptocurrencies. This shift is likely an indicator that the cryptocurrency industry has proven to be a more lucrative area for monetizing Sality.

2018-12: Sality has terrorized computer users since 2003, a year when personal digital assistants (PDAs) made tech headlines and office PCs ran Windows XP. Over the intervening years users traded their PDAs for smartphones and desktops migrated to newer operating systems and digital workplace solutions. Sality, however, survived the breakneck pace of technological innovation and continues to threaten organizations today.
