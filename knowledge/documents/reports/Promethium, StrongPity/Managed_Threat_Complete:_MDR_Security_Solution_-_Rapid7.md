Why just defeat adversaries when you can leave them discouraged, too?
Your leaked credentials won’t help them. Phishing and ransomware will be a waste of their time. With Managed Threat Complete, your environment is monitored end-to-end, 24/7, by an elite SOC that works transparently with your in-house team. Your resources expand. Your proactivity goes up. And your risks and worries go down.








See the difference an extended SOC approach makes









PROACTIVE & UNLIMITED


What if you had the resources to act first? What if you could anticipate the most relevant, imminent threats and prevent breaches earlier? Powered by an AI-led SecOps platform at the core, get unlimited data, unlimited response, unlimited vulnerability scanning, and unlimited potential.









GOODBYE SKILLS CRISIS


Partner with global, experienced SOC experts who seamlessly act as an extension of your SecOps team. We have you covered, from initial threat detection through triage, investigation, and response. Security leaders need better resources on their teams, at least as sophisticated as attackers.









FAST-START ROI


Unified exposure management and MDR creates a full picture of risk and threats – while driving greater efficiency. With unmatched time-to-value, you'll have tangible results and return on day one. And when you consolidate with the right partner, you save a lot more than money.















                            Command your attack surface
                        

Managed Threat Complete does what typical MDR can’t: smashes silos, changes the game, and changes your odds before, during, and after an attack.

Before, you’re anticipating attack vectors and preventing
During, you’re removing noise, pinpointing attacker actions, and acting to contain threats
After, unlimited digital forensics and incident response leaves your environment seriously improved

One single subscription delivers a comprehensive view into the kill chain and solves a long list of problems: the skills gap, budget pressures, tool sprawl, no time for proactive work, even your need for things like sleep and nice weekends.
