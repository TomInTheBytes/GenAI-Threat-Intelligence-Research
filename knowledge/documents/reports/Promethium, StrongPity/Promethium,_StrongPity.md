## Threat actor aliases

Promethium (Microsoft), StrongPity (Kaspersky), APT-C-41 (Qihoo 360)

## Description

Promethium is an activity group that has been active since at least 2012. The group conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. Promethium has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called {{Neodymium}} due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics.

(Microsoft) Promethium is an activity group that has been active as early as 2012. The group primarily uses Truvasys, a first-stage malware that has been in circulation for several years. Truvasys has been involved in several attack campaigns, where it has masqueraded as one of server common computer utilities, including WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, or SanDisk. In each of the campaigns, Truvasys malware evolved with additional features—this shows a close relationship between the activity groups behind the campaigns and the developers of the malware.

The observed domains all appeared to have been registered about two weeks after Citizen Lab’s report.  The malware has continued to adapt as new information is published. Minimal effort and code changes were all that was required to stay out of the limelight. Cylance observed new domains, new IP addresses, filename changes, and small code obfuscation changes.
