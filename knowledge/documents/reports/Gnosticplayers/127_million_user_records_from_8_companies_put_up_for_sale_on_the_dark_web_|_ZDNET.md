    127 million user records from 8 companies put up for sale on the dark web
   
    The same individual sold 620 million user accounts from 16 other companies earlier this week.

            Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor   Feb. 14, 2019 at 1:03 p.m. PT                      An individual who earlier this week was selling 620 million user records stolen from 16 companies has now put up a second batch of hacked data totaling 127 million, originating from eight companies. The data is currently being sold on Dream Market, a dark web marketplace where crooks sell an assortment of illegal products, such as user data, drugs, weapons, malware, and others. The individual selling the data goes by the name of Gnosticplayers, and it's currently unclear if they're the one/ones who hacked the 24 companies, or just a third-party who purchased the data from the real hacker and is now re-selling it for a bigger profit. According to tech news site TechCrunch, who first reported this new batch of hacked accounts going for sale on Dream Market, Gnosticplayers is asking for roughly four bitcoin, which is about $14,500 in fiat currency. Prices vary depending on the quality of the user data and the difficulty in cracking password hashes. This second batch of hacked accounts includes data from the following companies: CompanyDB sizeBreach datePriceContent 				 Ge.tt (file sharing service) 				1.83 Mil 				2017/12 				 ฿0.16 				firstname, lastname, password hash (SHA256), Facebook ID, referer 				 Ixigo (travel and hotel booking) 				18 Mil 				2019/01/01 				฿0.262 				password hashes (MD5), full name, Facebook URL, IP address, username, email, and, for some users even the passeport ID number, passeport name etc 				 Roll20.net (gaming) 				4 Mil 				2019/01/01 				฿0.0582 				name, email, passwords (bcrypt), nickname, gaming data, some redacted financial data, server log data 				 Houzz (interior design) 				57 Mil 				2018/07 				฿2.91 				email, password (SHA256), registration date, name 				 Coinmama (cryptocurrency exchange) 				0.42 Mil 				2017/08/02 				฿0.3497 				email, password (PHPASS), other unspecified 				Younow (live streaming) 				40 Mil 				2017/10 				฿0.131 				 								full name, profile ID, IP addresses, email, Facebook email and ID, Instagram ID, Google ID, Twitter ID 				StrongHoldKingdoms (gaming)   			 				5 Mil 				2018/09 				฿0.291 				username, email, password (HMAC-RIPEMD160), profile stats, gaming data, SteamID 				Petflow (pet food delivery)   			 				1 Mil 				2017 				฿0.1777 				email, username, password (MD5), other undisclosed data       Image: ZDNetOf the companies listed above, Houzz had already come clean about its data breach last week. The other seven companies did not publicly reveal any security breaches before the publication of today's ads. This new batch of stolen databases comes after earlier this week, the same Dream Market user was selling the following user databases from 16 other companies: CompanyDB sizeBreach datePriceContentDubsmash (video sharing)161.5 Mil2018/12฿0.549 user ID, password (SHA256), username, email, language, country, more500px (image hosting)14.8 Mil2018/07฿0.217 username, email, password (MD5, SHA512, or bcrypt), first and last name, birth date, gender, city, country EyeEm (image hosting)22.3 Mil2018/02฿0.289 email and password (SHA1)8fit (fitness app)20.1 Mil2018/07฿0.2025 email,  password (bcrypt), country, country code, Facebook token, Facebook profile picture, name, gender, and IP address Fotolog (photo app)16 Mil2018/12฿0.52 email, password (SHA256), security question and answer, name, location, various profile dataAnimoto (video editing service)25.4 Mil2018฿0.318 username, password hash (256), email, country, full name, and date of birt MyHeritage (family genealogy service)92 Mil2017/10฿0.549 email, password hash (256), account creation dateMyFitnessPal (UnderArmor's fitness app)150 Mil2018/02฿0.289 user ID, username, email, password hash (SHA1) with a fixed salt, IP address Artsy (art sharing portal)1 Mil2018/04฿0.0289 email, name, IP addresses, location, and password (SHA256) Armor Games (online gaming)11 Mil2018/12฿0.2749 username, email, password (SHA256), date of birth, gender, location, and profile dataBookmate (e-book and audiobook app)8 Mil2018/07฿0.159 username, email, password (SHA512 or bcrypt), gender, date of birth, and profile data CoffeeMeetsBagel (dating app)6 Millate 2017 to mid-2018฿0.13 full name, email, age, registration date, and gender DataCamp (coding platform)0.7 Mil2018/12฿0.013 email, password (bcrypt), location, and profile dataHauteLook (online shopping)28 Mil2018฿0.217 email, password (bcrypt), and name ShareThis (social sharing widegt)41 Mil2018/07฿0.217 name, username, email, password (DES), gender, date of birth, and profile dataWhitePages (online phone book)17.7 Millate 2017฿0.434 name, email, password (SHA1 or bcrypt)Animoto, MyFitnessPal and MyHeritage previously disclosed breaches last year. DataCamp, 500px, Dubsmash, EyeEm, Artsy, 8fit, and CoffeeMeetsBagel confirmed this week that they've been breached as well, giving credence to the seller's boast that this is real data and not just a scam. These 16 databases are no longer available for sale now. Gnosticplayers said he took them down after buyers complained that a prolonged sale would eventually lead to some of these databases leaking online, and becoming available to everyone. More updates to follow as we're still looking at the data.
