    Overview






    


    


Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are more important than ever, as endpoints remain the most exposed and exploited part of any network. The rise of malicious and automated cyber activity targeting endpoints leaves organizations struggling against attackers who easily exploit zero-day vulnerabilities with a barrage of ransomware attacks. 
IBM Security® QRadar® EDR provides a more holistic EDR approach that:

Remediates known and unknown endpoint threats in near real time with intelligent automation
Enables informed decision-making with attack visualization storyboards
Automates alert management to reduce analyst fatigue and focus on threats that matter
Empowers staff and helps safeguard business continuity with advanced continuous learning AI capabilities and a user-friendly interface







Enrich QRadar® SIEM logs with high-fidelity endpoint alerts

    Benefits





    


        




        



  
    Get a clear line of sight






    


    



Regain full control over all endpoint and threat activity with heightened visibility across your environment. Designed to be undetectable by adversaries, NanoOS technology provides deep visibility into the processes and applications running on endpoints.






        



  
    Automate your response






    


    



Our continuously-learning AI detects and responds autonomously in near real time to previously unseen threats and helps even the most inexperienced analyst with guided remediation and automated alert handling.






        



  
    Move from reactive to proactive






    


    



Get ahead of attackers with easy-to-create detection and response use cases that return results in seconds, leaving dormant threats with no room to hide. Easy-to-build use cases are deployed across the organization without interrupting endpoint uptime.

      An AI-powered alert management system helps to ease analyst workloads by autonomously handling alerts, reducing the number of false positives by 90% on average. It learns from analyst decisions, then retains the intellectual capital and learned behaviors to provide recommendations and speed response.
  




    


        











        



  
    Custom detection strategies 






    


    


            


  
  
      Detection Strategy (DeStra) scripting allows users to build custom detection strategies—beyond preconfigured models—to address compliance or company-specific requirements without the need to reboot the endpoint.
  




    


        











        



  
    Ransomware prevention






    


    


            


  
  
      Ransomware attacks are on the rise and will only continue to grow in frequency and complexity. Antivirus methods are no longer enough. QRadar EDR can help organizations detect and stop ransomware, in near real-time.
  




    


        






















        



  
    Behavioral tree






    


    


            


  
  
      A behavioral tree provides full alert and attack visibility. A user-friendly visual storyline helps analysts speed up their investigation and response. From here, analysts can also access containment controls and three stages of incidence response: triaging, response and protection policies.

                IBM Security QRadar EDR On-Premises
            

















        



  
    Managing a fleet of endpoints can be a challenge.






    


    


            


  
  
      In particular, organizations driven by security requirements, regulatory laws or data sovereignty concerns may not be able to use security solutions delivered as SaaS. QRadar EDR, now available on-premises, provides the freedom to select a deployment option that works for your environment, and helps meet compliance goals. This is particularly useful for clients in air-gapped environments.

    Rapid threat containment






    


    



Analysts will respond against active threats by way of termination and removal of malicious files or processes, creation of blocking policies or by isolating the endpoints.






        



  
    Proactive threat hunting






    


    



Proactive threat hunting is powered by X-Force threat intelligence and done continuously by the QRadar EDR console, which searches for potential indicators of attack and compromise.
