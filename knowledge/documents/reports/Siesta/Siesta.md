## Threat actor aliases

Siesta (Trend Micro)

## Description

(Trend Micro) In the past few weeks, we have received several reports of targeted attacks that exploited various application vulnerabilities to infiltrate various organizations. Similar to the {{Safe}} Campaign, the campaigns we noted went seemingly unnoticed and under the radar.

(FireEye) FireEye recently looked deeper into the activity discussed in TrendMicro’s blog and dubbed the “Siesta” campaign. The tools, modus operandi, and infrastructure used in the campaign present two possibilities: either the Chinese cyber-espionage unit {{Comment Crew, APT 1}} is perpetrating this activity, or another group is using the same tactics and tools as the legacy APT1.

The Siesta campaign reinforces the fact that analysts and network defenders should remain on the lookout for known, public indicators and for shared attributes that allow security experts to detect multiple actors with one signature.
