## Threat actor aliases

Whitefly (Symantec), Mofang (Fox-IT), TEMP.Mimic (FireEye), Bronze Walker (SecureWorks), ATK 83 (Thales), SectorM04 (ThreatRecon), Superman (?)

## Description

(Fox-IT) Mofang is a threat actor that almost certainly operates out of China and is probably government-affiliated. It is highly likely that Mofangâ€™s targets are selected based on involvement with investments, or technological advances that could be perceived as a threat to the Chinese sphere of influence. This is most clearly the case in a campaign focusing on government and critical infrastructure of Myanmar that is described in this report. Chances are about even, though, that Mofang is a relevant threat actor to any organization that invests in Myanmar or is otherwise politically involved. In addition to the campaign in Myanmar, Mofang has been observed to attack targets across multiple sectors (government, military, critical infrastructure and the automotive and weapon industries) in multiple countries.
