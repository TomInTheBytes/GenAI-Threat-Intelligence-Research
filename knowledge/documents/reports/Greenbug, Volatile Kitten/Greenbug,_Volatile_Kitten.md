## Threat actor aliases

Greenbug (Symantec), Volatile Kitten (CrowdStrike)

## Description

A subgroup of {{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}}.

(Symantec) Symantec discovered the Greenbug cyberespionage group during its investigation into previous attacks involving W32.Disttrack.B (aka Shamoon). Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first made headlines in 2012 when it was used in attacks against energy companies in Saudi Arabia. It recently resurfaced in November 2016 (W32.Disttrack.B), again attacking targets in Saudi Arabia. While these attacks were covered extensively in the media, how the attackers stole these credentials and introduced W32.Disttrack on targeted organizations’ networks remains a mystery.

Could Greenbug be responsible for getting Shamoon those stolen credentials?

Although there is no definitive link between Greenbug and Shamoon, the group compromised at least one administrator computer within a Shamoon-targeted organization’s network prior to W32.Disttrack.B being deployed on November 17, 2016.

2017-07: OilRig Uses ISMDoor Variant; Possibly Linked to Greenbug Threat Group
In July 2017, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016. Initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset, but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide, but also a different payload embedded inside it.
