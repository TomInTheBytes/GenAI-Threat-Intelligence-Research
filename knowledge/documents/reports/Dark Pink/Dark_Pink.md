## Description

(Group-IB) Group-IB, one of the global cybersecurity leaders, has today published its findings into Dark Pink, an ongoing advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign launched against high-profile targets in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Bosnia and Herzegovina that we believe, with moderate confidence, was launched by a new threat actor. To date, Group-IBâ€™s Threat Intelligence has been able to attribute seven successful attacks to this particular group from June-December 2022, with targets including military bodies, government ministries and agencies, and religious and non-profit organizations, although the list of victims could be significantly longer. Group-IB also noted one unsuccessful attack on a European state development body based in Vietnam.
