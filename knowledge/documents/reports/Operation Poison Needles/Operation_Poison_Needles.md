Operation Poison Needles (Qihoo 360)

## Description

(Qihoo 360) On the evening of November 29, 2018, shortly after the break-out of the Kerch Strait Incident, 360 Advanced Threat Response Team was the first security team to discover the APT attack against the FSBI “Polyclinic No.2” affiliated to the Presidential Administration of Russia. The lure document used to initiate the attack was a carefully forged employee questionnaire, which exploited the latest Flash 0day vulnerability CVE-2018-15982 and a customized Trojan with self-destruction function. All the technical details indicate that the APT group is determined to compromise the target at any price, but at the same time, it is also very cautious.
