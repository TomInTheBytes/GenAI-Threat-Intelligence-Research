## Description

(Group-IB) Group-IB Threat Intelligence team recently tracked a successful attack conducted on a Russian medical company by OldGremlin, a new criminal group. The threat actor encrypted the company's entire corporate network and demanded a $50,000 ransom. It is common knowledge that Russian hackers have an unspoken rule about not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries. Yet OldGremlin, made up of Russian speakers, is actively attacking Russian companies: banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, software developersâ€¦ According to Group-IB expert estimations, since the spring OldGremlin has conducted at least seven phishing campaigns. The hackers have impersonated the self-regulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye (SRO MiR); a Russian metallurgical holding company; the Belarusian plant Minsk Tractor Works; a dental clinic; and the media holding company RBC.
