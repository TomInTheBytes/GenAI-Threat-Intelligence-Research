## Description

(Malwarebytes) Lazarus Group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean government, motivated primarily by financial gain as a method of circumventing long-standing sanctions against the regime. They first came to substantial media notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated attacks against an assortment of South Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using DarkSeoul, a wiper program that overwrites sections of the victims’ master boot record.

In November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to Lazarus. The attack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony networks, the extensive amount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a wiper in a possible attempt to erase forensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks was largely hazy, but the FBI released a statement tying the Sony breach to the earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both incidents to North Korea.

Fast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of ransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North Korea rested largely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean attacks, but this was considered to be thin grounds given the common practice of tool sharing between regional threat groups. Western intelligence agencies released official statements to the public reaffirming the attribution, and on September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged a North Korean national with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.

Lazarus Group has 3 subgroups:
1. {{Subgroup: Andariel, Silent Chollima}}
2. {{Subgroup: BeagleBoyz}}
3. {{Subgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima}}

The following groups may be associated with the Lazarus Group: {{Covellite}}, {{Reaper, APT 37, Ricochet Chollima, ScarCruft}} and {{Wassonite}}.

## Reported hacking operations

2007: Operation “Flame”
Target: South Korean government.
Method: Disruption and sabotage.

2009-07: Operation “Troy”
North Korean hackers are suspected of launching a cyber-attack on some of the most important government offices in the US and South Korea in recent days, including the White House, the Pentagon, the New York Stock Exchange and the presidential Blue House in Seoul.
The attack took out some of South Korea’s most important websites, including those of the Blue House, the defense ministry, the national assembly, Shinhan bank, Korea Exchange bank and the top internet portal Naver.
Target: Government, financial and media institutions in South Korea and USA.
Method: DdoS attacks.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/08/south-korea-cyber-attack

2011-03: Attack on South Korean banks and media
Recent Distributed Denial of Service (DdoS) attacks on a number South Korean websites have been in news for the past week. The threat responsible for carrying out these attacks is Trojan.Koredos.
Target: South Korean organizations.
Method: DdoS attacks and destruction of infected machines.
https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojankoredos-comes-unwelcomed-surprise

2013-03: Operation “Ten Days of Rain” / ”DarkSeoul”
Computer networks running three major South Korean banks and the country’s two largest broadcasters were paralyzed Wednesday in attacks that some experts suspected originated in North Korea, which has consistently threatened to cripple its far richer neighbor.
The attacks, which left many South Koreans unable to withdraw money from A.T.M.’s and news broadcasting crews staring at blank computer screens, came as the North’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as threatening to destroy government installations in the South, along with American bases in the Pacific.
Target: Three broadcasting stations and a bank in South Korea.
Method: Infecting with viruses, stealing and wiping information.
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html

2013-05: South Korean Financial Companies Targeted by Castov
In the past few months we have been actively monitoring an exploit kit, called Gongda, which is mainly targeting South Korea. Interestingly, we have come across a piece of malware, known as Castov, being delivered by this exploit kit that targets specific South Korean financial companies and their customers. The cybercriminals in this case have done their research on the South Korean online financial landscape.
https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/south-korean-financial-companies-targeted-castov

2013-06: DarkSeoul Cyberattacks Against South Korea Continue on Anniversary of Korean War
Yesterday, June 25, the Korean peninsula observed a series of cyberattacks coinciding with the 63rd anniversary of the start of the Korean War. While multiple attacks were conducted by multiple perpetrators, one of the distributed denial-of-service (DdoS) attacks observed yesterday against South Korean government websites can be directly linked to the DarkSeoul gang and Trojan.Castov.

2014-11: Operation “Blockbuster”: Breach of Sony Pictures Entertainment
The attack on Sony Pictures became public knowledge on November 24, 2014, when Sony employees turned on their computers to be greeted with the sight of a neon red skeleton and the words “Hacked by GOP”, which stood for “Guardians of the Peace”. The message also threatened to release data later that day if an unspecified request was not met. Over the following weeks, huge swathes of information stolen from Sony were released, including: personal information about employees and their families; email correspondence between employees at the company; information about company salaries, unreleased Sony films, and other information.
Target: Sony Pictures Entertainment (released the “Interview” movie, ridiculing the North Korean leader).
Method: Infecting with malware, stealing and wiping data of the company’s employees, correspondence, copies of unreleased films.

2018-10: Operation “Sharpshooter”
Target: 87 organizations in many different sectors (majority Government and Defense) across the globe, predominantly in the United States.
Method: Rising Sun implant to gather intelligence.
https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-sharpshooter-targets-global-defense-critical-infrastructure/

2018-11: More Attacks on Cryptocurrency Businesses
Target: Some of the documents (for instance one entitled “sample document for business plan evaluation of venture company”) were prepared in Korean, presumably to target South Korean businesses. Another contains a business overview of what seems to be a Chinese technology consulting group named LAFIZ (“we couldn’t confirm if it’s a legitimate business or another fake company made up by Lazarus,” Kaspersky Lab researchers said). Yet another provided information for coin listings with a translation in Korean, researchers said.
Method: Documents containing weaponized macros, “carefully prepared to attract the attention of cryptocurrency professionals.” It utilizes PowerShell to control Windows systems and macOS malware for Apple users.

2019-04: “Hoplight” Malware Campaign
Known as “Hoplight,” the malware is a collection of nine files, though most of those are designed to work as obfuscation layers to keep admins and security software from spotting the attack.
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/10/lazarus_group_malware/

2019-05: North Korean Tunneling Tool: ELECTRICFISH
This report provides analysis of one malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be funneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a funneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password. This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system’s required authentication to reach outside of the network.
