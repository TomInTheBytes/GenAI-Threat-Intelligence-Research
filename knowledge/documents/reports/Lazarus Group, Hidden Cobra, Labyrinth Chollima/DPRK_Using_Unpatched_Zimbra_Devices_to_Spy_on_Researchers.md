Lazarus operated this campaign and other similar intelligence-gathering efforts through the end of 2022.The researchers named the campaign "No Pineapple" after an error message generated by the malware during their investigation. The threat actors quietly exfiltrated about 100GB of data, without waging any disruptive cyber operations or destroying information."The campaign targeted public and private sector research organizations, the medical research, and energy sector as well as their supply chain," the W Labs report added. "The motivation of the campaign is assessed to be most likely for intelligence benefit."About the Author(s)Dark Reading StaffDark ReadingDark Reading is a leading cybersecurity media site.See more from Dark Reading StaffKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.
