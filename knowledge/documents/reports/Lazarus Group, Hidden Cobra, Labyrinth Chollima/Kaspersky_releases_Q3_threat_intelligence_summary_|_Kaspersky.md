Woburn, MA – October 26, 2021 – Today Kaspersky announced that
its researchers witnessed Lazarus, a highly prolific advanced threat actor, developing
supply chain attack capabilities and using its multi-platform MATA framework
for cyber-espionage goals. This and other APT trends from across the world were
revealed in Kaspersky’s latest quarterly threat
intelligence summary.
Lazarus is one
of the world’s most active threat actors and has been active since at least
2009. This APT group has been behind large-scale cyber-espionage and ransomware campaigns and has
been spotted attacking the defense industry and cryptocurrency markets. With a
variety of advanced tools at their disposal, they appear to be applying them to
new goals.
In June 2021,
Kaspersky researchers observed the Lazarus group attacking the defense industry
using the MATA malware
framework, which can target three operating systems – Windows,
Linux and macOS. Historically, Lazarus has used MATA to attack various
industries for criminal purposes, such as stealing customer databases and
spreading ransomware. However, this time our researchers tracked Lazarus using
MATA for cyber-espionage. The actor delivered a Trojanized version of an
application known to be used by their victim of choice – a well-known Lazarus characteristic.
Notably, this is not the first time the Lazarus group has attacked the defense
industry. Their previous ThreatNeedle campaign was carried out in a similar
fashion in mid-2020.
Lazarus has also been spotted building supply chain attack capabilities
with an updated DeathNote cluster, which consists of a slightly updated variant
of BLINDINGCAN, malware previously reported by the US Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Kaspersky researchers discovered
campaigns targeting a South Korean think tank and an IT asset monitoring
solution vendor. In the first case discovered by Kaspersky researchers, Lazarus
developed an infection chain that stemmed from legitimate South Korean security
software deploying a malicious payload. In the second case, the target was a
company developing asset monitoring solutions in Latvia, an atypical victim for
Lazarus. As part of the infection
chain, Lazarus used a downloader named “Racket,” which they signed using a
stolen certificate. The actor compromised vulnerable web servers and uploaded
several scripts to filter and control the malicious implants on successfully
breached machines.
“These recent developments highlight two things:
Lazarus remains interested in the defense industry and is also looking to
expand its capabilities with supply chain attacks,” said Ariel Jungheit,
senior security researcher, Global Research and Analysis Team, Kaspersky. “This APT group is not the only one seen using supply chain attacks.
In the past quarter we have also tracked such attacks carried out by SmudgeX
and BountyGlad. When carried out successfully, supply chain attacks can cause devastating
results, affecting much more than one organization – something we saw clearly with
the SolarWinds attack last year. With threat actors investing in such
capabilities, we need to stay vigilant and focus defense efforts on that front.”
The Q3 APT trends report summarizes the
findings of Kaspersky’s subscriber-only threat intelligence reports, which also
include Indicators of Compromise (IoC) data and YARA rules to assist in
forensics and malware hunting. For more information, please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com 
In order to avoid falling victim to a targeted
attack by a known or unknown threat actor, Kaspersky researchers recommend
implementing the following measures:
·      
Provide your SOC team with access to the latest threat intelligence (TI). The Kaspersky Threat Intelligence
Portal is a single point of access for the company’s TI, providing cyberattack
data and insights gathered by Kaspersky spanning over 20 years. Free access to
its curated features that allow users to check files, URLs, and IP addresses,
are available here.
·      
Upskill your
cybersecurity team to tackle the latest targeted threats with Kaspersky
online training developed by GReAT experts.
·      
For endpoint
level detection, investigation, and timely remediation of incidents, implement
EDR solutions such as Kaspersky Endpoint
Detection and Response.
·      
In addition to
adopting essential endpoint protection, implement a corporate-grade security
solution that detects advanced threats on the network level at an early stage,
such as Kaspersky Anti
Targeted Attack Platform.
·      
As many
targeted attacks start with phishing or other social engineering techniques,
introduce security awareness training and teach practical skills to your team – for example, through the Kaspersky Automated
Security Awareness Platform.
