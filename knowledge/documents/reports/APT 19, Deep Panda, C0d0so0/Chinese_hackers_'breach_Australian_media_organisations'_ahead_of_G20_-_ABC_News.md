Vixen Panda is the one with the most focus on Australia," he said.Based on his research, Mr Alperovitch said he believed Vixen Panda was actually a Beijing-based military unit within the People's Liberation Army's Third Department.The Third Department, or 3PLA as it is known, is China's version of the US National Security Agency (NSA) or the Australian Signals Directorate."You have a unit of the Chinese military conducting espionage against Australian Government... and the information that they're stealing is being passed on through the military chain to the leadership of the Chinese government," he said.Posted 13 Nov 201413 Nov 2014Thu 13 Nov 2014 at 7:23am, updated 13 Nov 201413 Nov 2014Thu 13 Nov 2014 at 10:04amShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesSpy agency warns Australian business of G20-linked cyber attacksMore on:AustraliaChinaComputer ScienceCyber CrimeForeign AffairsInternet CultureWorld PoliticsTop StoriesPoliticians call for changes to 'unfair' HECS repayment systemAnalysis by Annabel CrabbAlbanese finds a Stage 3 commitment he can keepIsrael raids main hospital in Gaza as concerns grow over planned offensive in RafahAt least six banks affected by network outages, with payments, transfers and account access hitAlbanese follows Ardern down the aisle, revealing the challenge of keeping love and politics separateUkrainian torture victim says Russian interrogators were 'non-human'Alyssa Healy falls for 99 after digging Australia out of trouble on day one against South AfricaSpaceX launches Intuitive Machines' lunar craft in latest attempt for first successful commercial Moon landingPremier fears hundreds of sites across Sydney contaminated with asbestos, maybe including homesWhat does Prabowo Subianto winning Indonesia's presidential election mean for Indonesians in Australia?PM says no plan to change treatment of family home for aged care assets test'Hang your head in shame': Click-and-collect crook sentenced for stealing car with baby insideEducation bureaucrats apologise for 'restaurant rorts''The rental property sector in Australia is not a net taxpayer'.
