The Australian Crime Commission's former cyber security manager, Tim Wellsmore, said any information obtained would likely be passed to Chinese companies.Law firms hold confidential information that could give the companies inside knowledge ahead of business negotiations, mergers and acquisitions.In some cases, these firms are seen as weak links as they have not taken cyber security as seriously as some of their clients.Mr Wellsmore, who is now Director of Asia/Pacific Threat Intelligence for private security firm FireEye, said APT-19's origins remained unclear."Sometimes it is tricky to understand whether they are sitting there in uniforms working directly for the Chinese Government, or if they are sponsored and given resources but operate outside the Government hierarchy," he told the ABC."APT-19 is certainly acting in support of Chinese state interests but at this stage we have not been able to attribute them to serving members of the Chinese Government."Has China shifted up a gear?Representatives of the Chinese diaspora have responded to the consulate's soft power plays.Read moreFireEye observed at least seven phishing attacks directed at global law firms during May and June, some of which exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software.A spokesman for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which leads the Government's response to cybercrime, said hackers knew there was a low risk of being identified."[We] advise organisations to always think about the value of their data, know who has access to their data, know where their data is stored and review the protections in place to best secure their data," the spokesman said.The department did not respond to questions about whether APT-19 had compromised any sensitive information.Australian research body also hackedMr Wellsmore said his company had confirmed a Chinese attack on an Australian research and development body, but he would not say which one. Tim Wellsmore would not say which Australian research and development body had been hacked.(Twitter: Tim Wellsmore)"We have been involved in attacks in 2017 by the Chinese on research bodies within Australia and we continue to think this will be a focus for the Chinese in years to come," he said."There is a lot of research that would put them at a strategic advantage."The Australian Cyber Security Centre report found espionage activity was likely to focus on a country's gaps in technology or know-how.Fergus Hanson, head of cyber policy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said disclosing Chinese attacks may encourage criminals to improve their methods."In terms of sectors being targeted, I don't have a bird's-eye view, but I'd assume anything that lined up with China's interests — mining, energy defence or companies that would lead to them, such as law firms and suppliers," Mr Hanson said.APT-19 has 'global reach'Greg Austin, a professor at the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at UNSW, said he was not surprised the group was targeting Australian companies."APT-19 has a global reach and its targeting may well be 'automated' so it would not be targeting Australian firms uniquely," he said."In such cases, it is inevitable that some Australian firms get caught up."The threat of cyber espionage in the commercial world globally is very high because most firms present easy targets."Professor Austin said many Chinese cyber criminals were not connected to the Chinese Government."Statistics on Chinese arrests of cyber criminals are staggering — tens of thousands of arrests each year, and hundreds of criminal gangs using cyber attack," he told the ABC."It is the only country with such a high number of reported arrests for cyber crime."Posted 30 Nov 201730 Nov 2017Thu 30 Nov 2017 at 7:06pm, updated 4 Dec 20174 Dec 2017Mon 4 Dec 2017 at 5:37amShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesAustralian academic says he has been silenced by Chinese GovernmentBishop steps up warning to Chinese university studentsUniversities urged to be vigilant over Chinese influence on campusesMore on:AustraliaChinaDefence and National SecuritySecurity IntelligenceWorld PoliticsTop StoriesPoliticians call for changes to 'unfair' HECS repayment systemAnalysis by Annabel CrabbAlbanese finds a Stage 3 commitment he can keepIsrael raids main hospital in Gaza as concerns grow over planned offensive in RafahAt least six banks affected by network outages, with payments, transfers and account access hitAlbanese follows Ardern down the aisle, revealing the challenge of keeping love and politics separateUkrainian torture victim says Russian interrogators were 'non-human'Alyssa Healy falls for 99 after digging Australia out of trouble on day one against South AfricaSpaceX launches Intuitive Machines' lunar craft in latest attempt for first successful commercial Moon landingPremier fears hundreds of sites across Sydney contaminated with asbestos, maybe including homesWhat does Prabowo Subianto winning Indonesia's presidential election mean for Indonesians in Australia?PM says no plan to change treatment of family home for aged care assets test'Hang your head in shame': Click-and-collect crook sentenced for stealing car with baby insideEducation bureaucrats apologise for 'restaurant rorts''The rental property sector in Australia is not a net taxpayer'.
