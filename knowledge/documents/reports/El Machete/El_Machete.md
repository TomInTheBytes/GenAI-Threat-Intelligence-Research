## Threat actor aliases

El Machete (Kaspersky), TEMP.Andromeda (FireEye), APT-C-43 (Qihooo 360), ATK 97 (Thales), TAG-NS1 (Recorded Future)

## Description

(Kaspersky) “Machete” is a targeted attack campaign with Spanish speaking roots. We believe this campaign started in 2010 and was renewed with an improved infrastructure in 2012. The operation may be still “active”.

The malware is distributed via social engineering techniques, which includes spear-phishing emails and infections via Web by a fake Blog website. We have found no evidence of exploits targeting zero-day vulnerabilities. Both the attackers and the victims appear to be Spanish-speaking.

In some cases, such as Russia, the target appears to be an embassy from one of the countries of this list.

## Reported hacking operations

2017-03: We’ve found that this group has continued to operate successfully, predominantly in Latin America, since 2014. All attackers simply moved to new C2 infrastructure, based largely around dynamic DNS domains, in addition to making minimal changes to the malware in order to evade signature-based detection.

2019-03: From the end of March up until the end of May 2019, ESET researchers observed that there were more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the C&C server. This amounts to gigabytes of data being uploaded every week.
