"TheShadowBrokers is thinking this is information communication problem."The message also blindly lashes out at hackers, foreign intelligence services, and basically anyone else who hasn't bid on the files."TheShadowBrokers … is thinking peoples is having more balls, is taking bigger risks for to make advantage over adversaries," the group adds. "Equation Group is pwning you everyday, because you are giant fucking pussies."
So Shadow Brokers are implicitly criticising me for not buying their zero days, or what? Mustafa Al-BassamOctober 1, 2016
TheShadowBrokers originally made headlines after posting a sample of the cache, which contained exploit code matching the names and functionality of several previously-revealed NSA hacking tools. The contents and organization of the files led experts to conclude that they were accidentally left behind on a compromised server once used as a staging area by an NSA-linked hacking entity called Equation Group.That theory was reinforced last week, when Reuters reported that "four people with direct knowledge" of an FBI investigation into the leak had stated that the files were found by Russian hackers after NSA operatives "mistakenly" abandoned them on a remote server. There is still no conclusive evidence that TheShadowBrokers is associated with Russian intelligence services, however.Motherboard reached out to the hackers and will post an update if we receive a response. However, the group stated in their Medium post that they would only agree to interviews if offered money.Of course, it's not exactly surprising that no one is rushing to bid on the group's stolen files. While the tools are likely legit, the high profile of the leak makes it insanely risky, and the suspected age of the exploit code makes it unclear whether the hacks are even still effective.At the time of this writing, TheShadowBrokers have only received bids for a total of 1.76 bitcoins—or about $1,082—far below the group's asking price of $1 million.Tagged:nsaauctionmotherboard showShadow BrokersEQGRP_Auctionspying toolsTechMotherboardORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.0AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement© 2024 VICE MEDIA GROUP
