The company’s website is down, with a lengthy message to customers explaining that the ransomware attack began on July 4. While service has not been affected, the company noted that customer data may have been accessed. 
“As soon as we became aware of this incident, we took the necessary protective measures by immediately suspending the computer systems concerned. This protective action has led us to temporarily close our website and our customer area,” the company said. 
“Our IT teams are currently diagnosing the situation. Our first analyses establish that our servers essential to the operation of your mobile line have been well protected. On the other hand, it is possible that files present in the computers of La Poste Mobile employees have been affected. Some of them may contain personal data.”
The company urged customers to be wary of phishing messages or attempts at identity theft. Officials said customer service email addresses and phone numbers are still functioning.

The company has more than 1.8 million customers and was founded in 2011 by French postal service group La Poste and French telecommunications company SFR. The company brought in a revenue of about $517 million last year. 
La Poste Mobile is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, which are telecommunication providers that don’t own a network. It operates using SFR’s network. They offer a variety of services including prepaid phone credit, mobile phone plans and conventional phone packages.
On Friday, the LockBit ransomware group added the company to its list of victims. Two weeks ago, the ransomware gang introduced a revamped version of its tools, calling it “LockBit 3.0.”
Cybersecurity researchers have tracked a surge in LockBit activity over the last several months, and the group is poised to overtake Conti as the most prolific ransomware group in terms of publicly identified victims. 
Recent incidents attributed to the group include attacks on a Foxconn factory, a Canadian fighter jet training company, and a popular German library service.Malware NewsNews BriefsCybercrime NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsRansomwareData breachFranceLockBittelecommunicationsLockBit 3.0La Poste MobileNo previous articleNo new articlesJonathan GreigJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.
