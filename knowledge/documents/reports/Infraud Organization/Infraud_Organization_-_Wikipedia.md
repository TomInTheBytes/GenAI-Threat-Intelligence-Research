Infraud OrganizationFormationOctober 2010DissolvedFebruary 2018TypeCriminal organizationLocationInternationalServicesCardingMembership  10,901
Infraud Organization was an international cybercrime organization, operating between October 2010 and February 2018, that was involved in carding, stealing personal credit cards and online banking information.[1] The organization was created by Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a 34-year-old man from Ukraine. In February 2018, authorities in the United States indicted 36 individuals involved with the organization on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, possession of 15 or more access devices, and aiding and abetting. [2] As of February 2018, 13 of the 36 have been arrested. The US Justice Department stated that as of March 2017, the organization had 10,901 registered members[1] and was the "largest cyber fraud enterprise prosecutions ever undertaken by the Department of Justice" and had resulted in $530 million in actual losses, with an estimated $2.2 billion in intended losses.[3]
Presently (01/22/2022)


History[edit]
The organization was formed by Svyatoslav, a 34-year-old man from Ukraine. He intended for the organization to grow into the internet's largest carding group.[1] The website was a place where vendors could advertise stolen or counterfeit credit cards or related items. According to the indictment, the first vendor to advertise their items was Muhammad Shiraz who advertised large dumps of stolen credit card details for sale.[3]

At the time of the date (1/22/2022)
FSB arrested members of this organization
According to the card file of the Tverskoy Court of Moscow, Andrey Novak was sent to a pre-trial detention center yesterday. TASS calls this person the alleged founder of the hacker group The Infraud Organization.  The operation was carried out with the assistance of American intelligence agencies, who were looking for him on charges of cyberfraud.
According to media reports, three more alleged members of the group were placed under house arrest.
A case was initiated against Novak under Part 2 of Art. 272 of the Criminal Code of Russia (illegal access to computer information).

Organization Roles[edit]
The organization was split into different roles, the administrators, the super moderators, the moderators, vendors, VIP members and members.[2]
The administrators served as the governing council of the group, initially made up of "reputable" vendors. They handled management decisions, long-term strategic planning and managing of users of the site. Administrators had full privileges and access to the computer servers hosting Infraud's websites.
Super Moderators oversaw subject-matter specific areas of the forums which were either part of their expertise or was part of their geographical location. They were limited to editing and deleting posts by members as well as resolving disputes. They often reviewed other vendor's products or services which was in their area of expertise.
Moderators were similar to super moderators, however, they had less authority within the forums and were generally limited to moderating one or two specific sub-forums.
Vendors sold illicit product or services to other members of the organization which would usually be done through the vendor's website. Products or services would be reviewed by members to ensure that products which were purchased were of high quality and vendors of low-quality products or services did not remain in the organization.
VIP members were premiere members of the Infraud Organization. The role would be given to longstanding or notable members of the organization to distinguish them between members and vendors.
Members were general members of the organization who used the site to gather and provide information about perpetrating criminal activity as well as to use the vendors to facilitate unlawful purchases of credit card dumps and other illegal products or services.

Some vendors occasionally gave out free credit card dumps or compromised PayPal logins for fun, to showcase their products.
The indictment contains information about the crimes the individuals face, the roles of the organization, a list of each individuals name and their alias used within the Infraud organization, a brief explanation of their part in Infraud and examples of some of the crimes each individual committed. The charges in the indictment are only allegations, and are presumed innocent until proven guilty.[2]

Infraud Takedown[edit]

Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan from United States Department of Justice said that "as alleged in the indictment, Infraud operated like a business to facilitate cyberfraud on a global scale" and that "the Department of Justice refuses to allow these cybercriminals to use the perceived anonymity of the Internet as a shield for their crimes. We are committed to working closely with our international counterparts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes, wherever in the world they operate." Acting Executive Associate Director Benner from Homeland Security Investigations mentioned that "criminal cyber organizations like Infraud threaten not just U.S. citizens but people in every corner of the globe" and that "the actions of computer hackers and identity thieves not only harm countless innocent Americans, but the threat they pose to our financial system and global commerce cannot be overstated".[2]
