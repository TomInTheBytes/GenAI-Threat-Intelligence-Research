All About LAPSUS$: What We Know About the Extortionist Group [Updated]
On March 23, Bloomberg released an article tying the group’s ringleader to the online aliases “white” and “breachbase,” which belong to a 16-year-old UK minor. This individual was further tied to the aliases “WhiteDoxbin” and “Oklaqq” according to a KrebsOnSecurity article, also released yesterday. London Police did not reveal whether this individual was included in these arrests.

Updated March 24, 2022:
The City of London Police arrested seven individuals today, March 24, in connection with the extortionist group LAPSUS$, allegedly responsible for carrying out several high-profile attacks in recent weeks. Police revealed that all of the individuals arrested were between the ages of 16 and 21; no names are yet to be released. One of the threat actors arrested is said to have accumulated $14M as the fruits of their malicious cyber activities, according to the BBC.
On March 23, Bloomberg released an article tying the group’s ringleader to the online aliases “white” and “breachbase,” which belong to a 16-year-old UK minor. This individual was further tied to the aliases “WhiteDoxbin” and “Oklaqq” according to a KrebsOnSecurity article, also released yesterday. London Police did not reveal whether this individual was included in these arrests. 
This minor was previously doxed by a rival threat actor on January 9. The doxxer purported that the alleged LAPSUS$ mastermind had purchased Doxbin, an illicit leak and dox site, which has had its issues ever since. This dox also contained personally identifiable information (PII) for the individual, but due to their underage status, Flashpoint will not be sharing this information. 
The Bloomberg article also alluded to another LAPSUS$ member likely residing in Brazil, but did not provide an alias for this individual, suggesting perhaps this LAPSUS$ member may still be at large.
Yesterday LAPSUS$ made reference to a vacation being taken by some of the groups members in their Telegram channel—a probable reference to the arrests announced today. 
* * *LAPSUS$ is an extortionist threat group that became active on December 10, 2021. Unlike the majority of extortionist groups that typically rely on a combination of ransomware and data leaks, LAPSUS$ is focused on monetizing their operations exclusively through data leaks advertised on Telegram without the use of ransomware.
Initially, the group focused on data breaches against Latin American and Portuguese targets but in late February 2022, LAPSUS$ began widening the scope of its targeting by announcing it had successfully breached US-based graphics and computing chip manufacturer Nvidia. Since then, LAPSUS$ has continued to focus on large-scale international technology companies, including Microsoft, Okta, and Samsung, as the financial incentive for stealing source code and extorting companies for sensitive proprietary technical data is high.
Notable LAPSUS$ targets
LAPSUS$ is different from ransomware collectives in that the group is not encrypting the files of their victims, but rather gaining access to important files and threatening to leak if an extortion is not paid. 
Brazil’s Ministry of Health
LAPSUS$ claimed its first victim, Brazil’s Ministry of Health, on December 10, 2021. Since then, the group has claimed an additional 19 victims, the first 15 of which were all Latin American and Portuguese targets. 
Localiza
LAPSUS$ gained additional notoriety on when, on January 11, it began redirecting users of the official website for Localiza, one of the largest car rental conglomerates in Latin America, to a pornography site.
Vodafone Portugal
On February 8, Vodafone Portugal suffered a cyberattack impacting its 4G and 5G services. Initially, no group claimed responsibility, which was speculated to be either a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) or ransomware attack. But on February 24, LAPSUS$ admitted responsibility for the Vodafone Portugal attack on its Telegram channel.
Impresa and Confina
LAPSUS$ breached two of Portugal’s largest media companies: Impresa, on January 3 and Confina on February 6.
NVIDIA
In perhaps its most publicized attack to-date, LAPSUS$ claimed it carried out an attack against US-based graphics and computing chip manufacturer NVIDIA, successfully exfiltrated 1 TB of data from the company’s networks, including proprietary information related to NVIDIA’s GPUs, which is not set to be publicly launched for sale until March 29. Overall, LAPSUS$ has thus far released 150GB of stolen data as of this publishing.

The group also offered to separately sell a bypass for Nvidia’s Lite Hash Rate (LHR) limit imposed on Nvidia GPUs to make them more ineffective for crypto mining purposes in an effort to address the global chip shortage. The group stated the minimum offer they would entertain for the LHR bypass was US$1 million. 
Samsung
On March 4, LAPSUS$ posted a message in its official Telegram channel informing subscribers that it had carried out an attack against the South Korean electronics conglomerate, Samsung. The group later leaked 189 GB of stolen Samsung data and instructed Samsung to contact the group directly to prevent further leaks.s.
On March 7, Samsung revealed that it had suffered a data breach in which source code for Samsung Galaxy mobile devices had been stolen. However, the company stated that no personal customer or employee information was compromised as part of the breach. Samsung did not name a threat group responsible for the hack.
Microsoft
On March 20, 2022, LAPSUS$ claimed to have breached one of Microsoft’s Azure DevOps accounts. Later, on March 22, LAPSUS$ leaked 37 GB of stolen data which allegedly included partial source code for Bing, Bing Maps, and Cortana.
On March 22, Microsoft released a blog post detailing LAPSUS$ and confirmed that a single account had been compromised and source code was stolen as a result. However, Microsoft stated that customer data and code theft had not been witnessed and incident responders were able to halt the malicious activity. Microsoft also stated that confidentiality of source code was not one of their security methods as access to it does not increase risk. 
Okta
On March 22, LAPSUS$ claimed to have remote access and superuser and admin privileges on multiple Okta systems. LAPSUS$ stated that it did not steal data from Okta and the group’s focus was rather on Okta customers.

In response to LAPSUS$’s claims, Okta issued an official statement on March 22 in which the company revealed that in late January 2022, it had detected an attempt to compromise an account belonging to a third-party customer support engineer. Okta stated that it investigated the incident and was able to contain it. The company stated that the screenshots shared by LAPSUS$ appeared to be related to this late January incident and that the company’s investigations have not identified additional evidence of current malicious activity.
LAPSUS$ and insider threats
Since LAPSUS$ became active in December 2021, they have actively sought out corporate and government insiders which could provide the group with remote internal network access. 
LAPSUS$ has emphasized that it is not interested in corporate data stolen from insiders but was specifically interested in network access, listing VPNs, Citrix, and AnyDesk as network access type examples.
On March 10, 2022, LAPSUS$ posted a advertisement (below) seeking to recruit insiders employed who could provide remote corporate network access through VPN or virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) credentials within the following sectors:

Telecommunications companies
Large software and/or gaming companies
Call centers and business process management (BPM) providers
Server hosting providers

Even prior to this latest insider recruitment advertisement, Flashpoint has observed multiple instances of LAPSUS$ insider recruitment attempts in the LAPSUS$ Telegram group going back to the group’s founding in December 2021. For example, on December 12, 2021, the group offered to pay potential Brazilian Federal Police insiders within their Telegram group chat $15,000 for internal network access to Brazil’s Federal Police network.
Although Flashpoint has not observed an example of an insider providing LAPSUS$ with access which later led to a real world attack, it’s likely that if an insider has provided access to LAPSUS$ that has enabled an attack, these conversations likely would have taken place via private direct messages. 
Based on LAPSUS$’s history of openly soliciting for corporate network accesses, Flashpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this is at least one if not the primary method the group is gaining initial access to victim organizations. As the group has also demonstrated a preference in login credentials for remote network gateways, it’s also possible that the group could be procuring a portion of these accesses through dark web purchases such as browser stealer malware logs which are readily available for purchase on several dark web account shops and marketplaces.
