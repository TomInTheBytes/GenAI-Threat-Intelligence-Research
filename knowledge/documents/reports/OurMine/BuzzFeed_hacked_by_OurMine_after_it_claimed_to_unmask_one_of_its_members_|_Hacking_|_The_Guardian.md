In response, on Wednesday the hackers managed to breach BuzzFeed with a post, which has since been taken down, that read:“Hacked by OurMine team, don’t share fake news about us again, we have your database. Next time it will be public. Don’t fuck with OurMine again.”TechCrunch falls victim to OurMine hacking groupRead moreAsked in an email to clarify what “we have your database” meant, an email account associated with the group told the Guardian: “Emails, Passwords Hashes, Usernames.”Previous high-profile hacks by the group include attacks on HSBC, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales. The group also took down the servers for Niantic’s popular augmented-reality game Pokémon Go in July.Makki did not respond to a request for comment. A statement on OurMine’s website reads: “Yesterday Buzzfeed Created a post that we are only 1 member called Ahmed Makki, and we can confirm that we don’t Have a member called ‘Ahmed Makki’ and we are now 4 we were 3 but someone joined, and we hacked it because they are reporting fake news about us.”“We have a member known as ‘Makki’ But not ahmad makki, and he is not from saudi arabia,” the statement continued.In a series of conversations in July between the Guardian and a number of accounts verified as being associated with OurMine, a picture emerged of a group of three (now four) ambitious former “black hat” – or malicious – hackers, all male, from several different countries, aged between 17 and 22.The group’s aim, two members told the Guardian, was to make a name for themselves as “white hat” information security consultants.OurMine makes no money from its more eye-catching hacks, one said. However, he claimed it made $20,000 to $40,000 every month from their security consultancy.One of their hackers, who calls himself Abody, told the Guardian that he worked for Microsoft as a day job, though this could not be verified. He said that he was most proud of the Pichai hack, which he said had been achieved using a vulnerability in the crowdsourced question-and-answer social network Quora.Asked what he enjoys about hacking, he said that he “just wants to upgrade people security”, and he said he wanted OurMine to be “the biggest security group in the world”.Abody said that he learned hacking “when I was 10, my friend was a hacker. He showed me his methods at hacking, and we learned a lot of hacking together, now we are working for OurMine.”The group’s approach seems to be working. OurMine has swiftly made a name for itself with high-profile hacks such as that of Pichai –but some of its smaller hacks do seem to have resulted in people taking them on as security consultants.One of its clients, a YouTube video-maker called Jordi van den Bussche, told the Guardian his social media accounts were hacked by the group in 2015. After he responded to its message, he said: “Once we started talking I realised that they kinda do it for fun and to help people, instead of trying to steal money or information. I then challenged them to try and hack me again and they did! Multiple times!”“They helped me improve my security and because of them I managed to protect all my information from other hackers. Since their tips and tricks I realised that hackers aren’t always bad. These guys might have a bad name but to me they are just trying to help,” Van den Bussche said.Explore more on these topicsHackingBuzzFeedDigital mediaInternetnewsReuse this contentComments (…)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
