The hacks took place before the Super Bowl, in order to gain the group reputational points and media coverage.At the time, ZDNet reported that the unauthorized tweets posted on the Twitter timelines of NFL and its teams were posted via an app named Khoros, an app that's usually used by digital marketing and public relations departments.According to screenshots taken by users today, the defacement tweets that have been posted on Facebook's Twitter accounts were posted via the same Khoros app.@campuscodi Add another to the Khoros pile pic.twitter.com/NX2J5dDsdj— Eyewitness Jews (@EyewitnessJews) February 7, 2020
Last week, a Khoros spokesperson told ZDNet that their platform was not compromised during the NFL account defacements. In a statement, the NFL confirmed this adding that it detected individual attacks against all of its teams social media accounts.The OurMine crew has a long history of breaking into high-profile social media accounts.
