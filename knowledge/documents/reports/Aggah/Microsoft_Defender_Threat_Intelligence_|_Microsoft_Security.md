Microsoft tracks more than 65 trillion signals daily, helping security teams identify vulnerabilities with greater efficacy and stay ahead of today's cyberthreats.






















Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence is a complete cyberthreat intelligence platform. It helps security professionals analyze and act upon signals collected from the internet by a global collection network and processed by security experts and machine learning. These data sets show the infrastructure connections across the global cyberthreat landscape, uncovering an organization’s vulnerabilities and enabling teams to investigate the tools and systems used in cyberattacks. Defender Threat Intelligence provides external context for internal security incidents via SIEM and XDR capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR.
