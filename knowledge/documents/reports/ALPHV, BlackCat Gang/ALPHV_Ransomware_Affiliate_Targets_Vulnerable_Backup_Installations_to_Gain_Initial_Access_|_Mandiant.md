A commercial Internet scanning service identified over 8,500 installations of Veritas Backup Exec instances that are currently exposed to the internet, some of which may still be unpatched and vulnerable. Previous ALPHV intrusions investigated by Mandiant primarily originated from stolen credentials suggesting a shift to opportunistic targeting of known vulnerabilities. This blog post covers the UNC4466 attack lifecycle, indicators, and detection opportunities.ALPHV emerged in November 2021 as a ransomware-as-a-service that some researchers have claimed is the successor to BLACKMATTER and DARKSIDE ransomware. While some ransomware operators enacted rules to avoid impacting critical infrastructure and health entities, ALPHV has continued to target these sensitive industries.TimelineIn March 2021, Veritas published an advisory reporting three critical vulnerabilities in Veritas Backup Exec 16.x, 20.x and 21.x.On September 23, 2022, a METASPLOIT module was released which exploits these vulnerabilities and creates a session which the threat actor can use to interact with the victim system. On October 22, 2022, Mandiant first observed exploitation of the Veritas vulnerabilities in the wild.Attack PhasesInitial Compromise and Establish FootholdIn late 2022, UNC4466 gained access to an internet-exposed Windows server, running Veritas Backup Exec version 21.0 using the Metasploit module `exploit/multi/veritas/beagent_sha_auth_rce`. Shortly after, the Metasploit persistence module was invoked to maintain persistent access to the system for the remainder of this intrusion.Internal ReconnaissanceAfter gaining access to the Veritas Backup Exec server, UNC4466 used Internet Explorer, the browser installed by default on older Windows systems, to download Famatech’s Advanced IP Scanner from its website, hxxps://download.advanced-ip-scanner[.]com. This tool is capable of scanning individual IP addresses or IP address ranges for open ports, and returns hostnames, operating system and hardware manufacturer information.UNC4466 also made use of ADRecon to gather network, account, and host information in the victim’s environment. When executed by a privileged domain account, ADRecon generates several reports about the Active Directory environment, including the Trusts, Sites, Subnets, password policies, user and computer account listings. These reports can be generated in a variety of formats, including CSV, XML, JSON, and HTML. Ingress Tool TransferUNC4466 made heavy use of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download additional tools such as LAZAGNE, LIGOLO, WINSW, RCLONE, and finally the ALPHV ransomware encryptor.Command and ControlUNC4466 leveraged SOCKS5 tunneling to communicate with compromised systems in the victim network. This technique is typically used to evade network defenses or other preventative network controls. Two separate tools were deployed to execute this technique, LIGOLO and REVSOCKS.Escalate PrivilegesThe threat actor utilized multiple credential access tools, including Mimikatz, LaZagne and Nanodump to gather clear-text credentials and credential material. In November 2022, UNC4466 utilized the MIMIKATZ Security Support Provider injection module (`MISC::MemSSP`). This module collects credentials in clear text as they are used, by manipulating the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) on victim systems. This module creates a file named `C:\Windows\System32\mimilsa.log`.[Nanodump] was also used to dump LSASS memory. Like the examples shown on Helpsystems' GitHub page, the output file specified was a file in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory.Defense EvasionDuring operations, UNC4466 takes steps to evade detection. Apart from clearing event logs, UNC4466 also used the built in Set-MpPrefernce cmdlet to disable Microsoft Defender’s real-time monitoring capability.powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinueCommand and ControlUNC4466 made use of BITS transfers (using the Start-BitsTransfer PowerShell cmdlet) to download various resources to the staging directory `c:\ProgramData`. Using this technique, SOCKS5 tunneling tools, REVSOCKS and LIGOLO were downloaded from their official GitHub repositories.Complete MissionUNC4466 deploys the Rust-based ALPHV ransomware. In Late 2022, UNC4466 added immediate tasks to the default domain policy. These tasks were configured to perform actions which disabled security software, downloaded the ALPHV encryptor, then execute it.ExposureAs of this blog post's date, one commercial Internet scanning service reported over 8500 IP addresses which advertise the "Symantec/Veritas Backup Exec ndmp" service on the default port 10000, as well as port 9000 and port 10001. While this search result does not directly identify vulnerable systems, as the application versions were not identifiable, it demonstrates the prevalence of Internet exposed instances that could potentially be probed by attackers. Detection Opportunities Defenders should place priority on monitoring internet-exposed Veritas Backup Exec Windows installations, for versions before 21.2. Mandiant observed the exploitation of Veritas Backup Exec can leave a noticeable imprint on the Backup Exec log files. Where feasible, these log files should be forwarded to a SIEM or similar technology which enables detection and alerting when certain events are recorded.In addition to any available network connection logging, Veritas Backup Exec logs will record evidence of connections to remote systems.

Additionally, organizations should inventory externally facing services and reduce the attack surface available to attackers.AcknowledgementsWith special thanks to Nick Richard for technical review.MITRE ATT&CKMandiant has observed UNC4466 use the following techniques:ATT&CK Tactic CategoryTechniquesImpact T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact T1489: Service Stop T1490: Inhibit System Recovery T1529: System Shutdown/RebootExecution T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation T1053: Scheduled Task/Job T1053.005: Scheduled Task T1059.001: PowerShell T1059.006: Python T1569.002: Service ExecutionDefense Evasion T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information T1027.002: Software Packing T1027.009: Embedded Payloads T1055: Process Injection T1070.001: Clear Windows Event Logs T1070.004: File Deletion T1112: Modify Registry T1134: Access Token Manipulation T1134.001: Token Impersonation/Theft T1222: File and Directory Permissions Modification T1497: Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion T1497.001: System Checks T1548.002: Bypass User Account Control T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools T1564.010: Process Argument Spoofing T1574.011: Services Registry Permissions Weakness T1620: Reflective Code Loading T1622: Debugger Evasion T1484.001Domain Policy Modification: Group Policy ModificationDiscovery T1007: System Service Discovery T1012: Query Registry T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery T1033: System Owner/User Discovery T1057: Process Discovery T1082: System Information Discovery T1083: File and Directory Discovery T1087: Account Discovery T1135: Network Share DiscoveryPersistence T1543: Create or Modify System Process T1543.003: Windows Service T1547.001Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup FolderCommand and Control T1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol T1105: Ingress Tool TransferLateral Movement T1021.001: Remote Desktop ProtocolCollection T1213: Data from Information RepositoriesResource Development T1583.003: Virtual Private ServerIndicators of Compromiseda202cc4b3679fdb47003d603a93c90dMIMIKATZ5fe66b2835511f9d4d3703b6c639b866NANODUMP1f437347917f0a4ced71fb7df53b1a05LIGOLOb41dc7bef82ef384bc884973f3d0e8caREVSOCKSc590a84b8c72cf18f35ae166f815c9dfSysinternals PSEXEC24b0f58f014bd259b57f346fb5aed2eaWINSWe31270e4a6f215f45abad65916da9db4REVSOCKS4fdabe571b66ceec3448939bfb3ffcd1Advanced Port Scanner68d3bf2c363144ec6874ab360fdda00aLAZAGNEee6e0cb1b3b7601696e9a05ce66e7f37ALPHVf66e1d717b54b95cf32154b770e10ba4METASPLOIT17424a22f01b7b996810ba1274f7b8e9METASPLOIT45[.]61[.]138[.]109 185[.]141[.]62[.]123 5[.]199[.]169[.]209 45[.]61[.]138[.]109:45815 45[.]61[.]138[.]109:43937 45[.]61[.]138[.]109:36931 5[.]199[.]169[.]209:31600 45[.]61[.]138[.]109:41703 185[.]99[.]135[.]115:39839 185[.]99[.]135[.]115:41773 45[.]61[.]138[.]109:33971 185[.]141[.]62[.]123:50810 185[.]99[.]135[.]115:49196 hxxp://185[.]141[.]62[.]123:10228/update[.]exe  Link to RSS feedPrepare for 2024's cybersecurity landscape.Get the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Forecast 2024 report to explore the latest trends on the horizon.
