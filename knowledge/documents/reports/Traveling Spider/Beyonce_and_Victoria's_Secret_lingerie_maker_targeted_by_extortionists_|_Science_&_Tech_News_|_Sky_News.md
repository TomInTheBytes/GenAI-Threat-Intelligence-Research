Why you can trust Sky News


A Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer which produces lingerie for brands including Beyonce's Ivy Park, Nike, and Victoria's Secret has been targeted by cyber extortionists.The criminal group is demanding a ransom from MAS Holdings after stealing what it claims is 300 GB of private files and posting some allegedly stolen documents online as evidence.



Among the documentation published by the criminals as proof was an index list of files it claimed belonged to MAS Holdings, notably including audit documents featuring worker payroll summaries.The hackers could potentially also seek to exploit the alleged breach to target MAS Holdings' commercial partners.MAS Holdings declined to tell Sky News whether it had alerted these partners to the alleged breach, or if any of their data had been affected.





In an email, the company stated: "MAS is constantly reviewing its security posture and threat actors do attempt to penetrate our network at times. We also adopt best practices in line with industry standards in managing such threats."The company added: "We have no further comments at this time."

The attempted extortion comes from a group known as Nefilim, which first posted what it claimed was stolen data from MAS Holdings online a number of weeks ago.Although this data was subsequently taken down, it has now been re-uploaded alongside more data it claims is from the company's network. It is not clear whether communications between the group and MAS Holdings caused this.

The extortion attempt was flagged to Sky News by Brett Callow, a senior researcher at cyber security firm Emsisoft, who specialises in tracking these ransomware groups.He said: "Nefilim is one of a number of ransomware groups which steal documents from their victims and use the threat of posting it online as additional leverage to extort payment."The stolen data is increasingly being weaponised in these cases with groups threatening to sell it on the dark web or to competitors, or to use it for identity theft, or to spear phish customers and business partners."Spear phishing is a targeted form of email phishing which presents itself as originating from an authentic source based on information the attackers have gained elsewhere, to seem more realistic and persuasive."A company in this situation has no good options available to it," explained Mr Callow."The data may be misused or monetised whether the company pays or not. Speedy disclosure is absolutely critical in these cases given the risk they present to the both individuals and other companies."Sky News could not contact Ivy Park for comment as no details for contacting the company are available on its website.Nike and Victoria's Secret has been approached for comment.
