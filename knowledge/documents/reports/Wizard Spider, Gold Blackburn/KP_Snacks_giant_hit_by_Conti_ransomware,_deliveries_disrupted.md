KP Snacks giant hit by Conti ransomware, deliveries disrupted

KP Snacks, a major producer of popular British snacks has been hit by the Conti ransomware group affecting distribution to leading supermarkets.
Kenyon Produce (KP) Snacks includes popular brands such as PopChips, Skips, Hula Hoops, Penn State pretzels, McCoy's, Wheat Crunchies, etc.
KP Snacks has more than 2,000 employees and estimates put the company's annual revenue at over $600 million, making them an attractive target for threat actors.
Conti plans to leak sensitive documents
A cyber attack on British snack giant, KP Snacks has now escalated to supply chain disruption around the UK.
Because of the attack, deliveries from the company to leading superstores are reportedly being delayed or canceled altogether. According to discussions between KP Snacks and its partner supermarkets, the supply shortage issues can last until the end of March.

Letter sent by KP Snacks to supermarkets like Nisa (betterRetailing)
A source informed BleepingComputer that the company's internal network had been breached with threat actors gaining access to and encrypting sensitive files, including employee records and financial documents.
Private leak pages seen by BleepingComputer show Conti ransomware group claiming responsibility for the attack:

On the private leak page, Conti shared samples of credit card statements, birth certificates, spreadsheets with employee addresses and phone numbers, confidential agreements, and other sensitive documents.  
Darknet intel provider DarkFeed had also posted yesterday about Conti ransomware op giving the company five days before leaking even more proprietary data on their public blog.
It isn't clear if KP Snacks is currently negotiating with Conti or if it will pay a ransom.
"On Friday, 28 January we became aware that we were unfortunately victims of a ransomware incident," a KP Snacks spokesperson told BleepingComputer.
"As soon as we became aware of the incident, we enacted our cybersecurity response plan and engaged a leading forensic information technology firm and legal counsel to assist us in our investigation."
The company's internal IT teams are working with third party security experts to assess the situation.
"We have been continuing to keep our colleagues, customers, and suppliers informed of any developments and apologise for any disruption this may have caused," concluded the company in their statement to us.
Conti repeatedly hits high-profile organizations
Conti is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation linked to the Wizard Spider Russian cybercrime group, also known for other notorious malware, including Ryuk, TrickBot, and BazarLoader.
The ransomware group's affiliates breach targets' networks after corporate devices get infected with BazarLoader or TrickBot malware, providing them remote access to the compromised system.
In recent weeks, Conti has rapidly climbed up the ranks among ransomware groups after repeatedly targeting prominent organizations.
Last month, Conti claimed responsibility for attacking Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, and began leaking its data.
In December 2021, Conti had breached the systems of Nordic Choice hotel group, freezing the hotel properties' key cards.
The ransomware gang's former targets have included Ireland's Department of Health (DoH) and Health Service Executive (HSE), and marketing giant RR Donnelly (RRD).
Due to increased Conti activity, the FBI, CISA, and the NSA US have also recently issued an advisory warning of an increased number of Conti ransomware attacks.
Update Feb 3, 01:35 AM ET: Added a copy of the letter sent by KP Snacks to partner supermarkets.
