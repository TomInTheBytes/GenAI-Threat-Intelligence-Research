It is not yet known what group or individual launched the ransomware.Australian hospitals struckSeparately, seven hospitals in Australia have also reported disruptive ransomware infections."Some elective surgery and appointments have been cancelled," said Barwon Health, one hospital operator affected by the incident.The Government of Victoria said the seven hospitals were located in Gippsland and south-west Victoria.Multiple computer systems have had to be disconnected as a result, which has meant some patient record, booking and management services have been shut down. This could affect efforts to contact patients and schedule appointments, the Government of Victoria said: "Where practical, hospitals are reverting to manual systems to maintain their services."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Technology explained: what is ransomware?In cases where patient histories, charts, images and other information has been made unavailable, it may be necessary to reschedule some appointments, the authority added.Daniel Andrews, Premier of Victoria, told local media it could take "weeks" before the problems were fixed.The Victorian Government Cyber Incident Response Service has dealt with more than 600 cyber-attacks since July 2018."Unfortunately the groups breaking into individual computers at organisations are becoming rapidly better at obtaining access across networks, and then causing chaos with a goal to being paid," said UK-based cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont."This problem isn't going to go away," he added.He said organisations needed to review their security procedures and ensure that backups were in place - and also that such backups had been recently tested - so that data and systems could be restored in the event of a ransomware infection.More on this storyTexas government bodies hit by ransomware attackPublished19 August 2019Two US towns pay $1.1m ransom to hackersPublished26 June 2019How a ransomware attack cost one firm £45mPublished25 June 2019Top StoriesLive. Israeli special forces raid Nasser hospital in Khan YounisLive. Trump's first criminal trial set to begin next monthWhy Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seemsPublished2 hours agoFeaturesWhy Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seemsHow much do Nato members spend on defence?Kansas City celebration turns to scene of chaosUkraine battles frostbite and shell shortage in ruined townWhat can Indonesia expect from a Prabowo presidency?French migration row engulfs island in Indian Ocean'I had 60 seconds to protect my family': Swatting targets US politiciansFace to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jailKnown to fans of The 1975 as the Virgin MaryElsewhere on the BBCHow the codpiece floppedWhere it's taboo if dads don't take parental leaveThe scuzzy New York club that gave birth to punkMost Read1Why Putin's backing for Biden is not what it seems2One dead and 21 injured in Super Bowl parade shooting3Deadly strike on Russian shopping centre near border4Trump prosecutor's affair focus of misconduct hearing5Tribute to black women wins at Rio Carnival parade6'Love is a beautiful thing': Australian PM gets engaged7Spain triple murder suspect held for prison killing8Face to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jail9Lioness, Suffragette: New lines on Tube map revealed10Ukraine battles frostbite and shell shortage in ruined townBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with us© 2024 BBC.
