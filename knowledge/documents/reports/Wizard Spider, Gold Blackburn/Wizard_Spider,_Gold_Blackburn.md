## Description

Wizard Spider is reportedly associated with {{Lunar Spider}}.

Dyre has been observed to be distributed by Cutwail (operated by {{Narwhal Spider}}), as well as their own botnets Gophe and Upatre.

TrickBot has been observed to be distributed via Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}), BokBot (operated by {{Lunar Spider}}), Smoke Loader (operated by {{Smoky Spider}}), DanaBot (operated by {{Scully Spider, TA547}}), Kelihos (operated by {{Zombie Spider}}), Necurs (operated by {{Monty Spider}}) and Taurus Loader (operated by {{Venom Spider, Golden Chickens}}), as well as their own botnet Gophe.
