Insikt Report: Suspected Chinese Threat Activity Group RedFoxtrot















































Threat Activity Group RedFoxtrot Linked to Chinese Military Targets Bordering Asian Countries

Insikt Research Report


Using a combination of large-scale, automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified ties between a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked as RedFoxtrot and the Chinese military intelligence apparatus, People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010, located in Ürümqi, Xinjiang. The cyber activity of the PLA has largely been a black box for the intelligence community since its 2015 organizational restructuring. Since then, public reporting has largely concentrated on groups linked to China’s Ministry of State Security. This breakthrough report changes that, providing a rare glimpse into PLA cyber espionage operations.
