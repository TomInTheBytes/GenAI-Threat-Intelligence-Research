It contains hidden files, an LNK file that initiates the infection, and an executable file designed to unhide a decoy document while executing Advanced Monitoring Agent, a remote administration tool.This is the first public report about MuddyWater utilizing this remote administration tool.The Multi-stage Social Engineering CampaignWhile Deep Instinct could not verify the spreading mechanism of the new campaign, it most likely starts with a spear-phishing email, similar to previous campaigns.The content of the email lures the victim into downloading an archive hosted at “a.storyblok[.]com”In this analysis, we examine the “defense-video.zip” file.When the archive is extracted, several folders must be navigated until a LNK shortcut, which looks like another folder named “Attachments,” is found:Figure 2: LNK ShortcutHowever, there are additional hidden folders and files extracted from the archive:Figure 3: Hidden foldersWhen the victim opens the LNK file, the infection chain starts.By examining the LNK file, we can see that it executes an executable from one of the hidden directories:Figure 4: LNK command line argumentsThe file “Diagnostic.exe” has been used in both archives Deep Instinct observed. The purpose of this file is to execute another executable called “Windows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE,” which is located in the hidden directory named “.end” under a “Windows.Diagnostic.Document” hidden directory.The file named “Windows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE” is a signed, legitimate installer for “Advanced Monitoring Agent.”In addition to executing the remote administration tool, “Diagnostic.exe” also opens a new Windows Explorer window of the hidden “Document” folder. This is done to fool the victim that opened the LNK file into thinking that it was indeed a folder.The decoy document is an official memo from the Israeli Civil Service Commission, which can be publicly downloaded from their website.The memo describes what to do in case a government worker expresses opinions against the Israeli state on social networks:Figure 5: Decoy documentConclusionMuddyWater continues to attack Israeli targets in various ongoing campaigns.In this campaign, MuddyWater employs updated TTPs. These include a new public hosting service, employing a LNK file to initiate the infection, and utilizing intermediate malware that mimics the opening of a directory while executing a new remote administration tool.After the victim has been infected, the MuddyWater operator will connect to the infected host using the legitimate remote administration tool and will start doing reconnaissance on the target.After the reconnaissance phase, the operator will likely execute PowerShell code which will cause the infected host to beacon to a custom C2 server.MuddyWater has used PhonyC2 in the past. However, Deep Instinct recently observed MuddyWater using a new C2 framework named MuddyC2Go – a detailed blog will be published soon, stay tuned.IOCs:FileMD5Description37c3f5b3c814e2c014abc1210e8e69a2Archive containing Atera Agent16923d827a440161217fb66a04e8b40aAtera Agent Installer7568062ad4b22963f3930205d1a14df7Archive containing Atera Agent39eea24572c14910b67242a16e24b768Archive containing Atera Agent2e09e53135376258a03b7d793706b70fAtera Agent Installer1f0b9aed4b2c8d958a9b396852a62c9dArchive containing SimpleHelp065f0871b6025b8e61f35a188bca1d5cSimpleHelp Installer146cc3a1a68be349e70b79f9115c496bdefense-video.zipdd247ccd7cc3a13e1c72bb01cf3a816dAttachments.lnk8d2199fa11c6a8d95c1c2b4add70373aDiagnostic.exe04afff1465a223a806774104b652a4f0Advanced Monitoring Agent Installer6167f03c8b2734c20eb02d406d3ba651Decoy Document (defense-video.zip)e8f3ecc0456fcbbb029b1c27dc1faad0attachments.zip952cc4e278051e349e870aa80babc755Decoy Document (attachments.zip)NetworkIP or URLDescriptionws.onehub[.]com/files/7f9dxtt6URL to Archive of Atera Agenta.storyblok[.]com/f/253959/x/b92ea48421/form.zipURL to Archive of Atera Agenta.storyblok[.]com/f/255988/x/5e0186f61d/questionnaire.zipURL to Archive of Atera Agenta.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/94f59e378f/questionnaire.zipURL to Archive of SimpleHelp146.70.149[.]61MuddyWater’s SimpleHelp server146.70.124[.]102Suspected MuddyWater’s SimpleHelp server37.120.237[.]204Suspected MuddyWater’s SimpleHelp server37.120.237[.]248Suspected MuddyWater’s SimpleHelp servera.storyblok[.]com/f/259837/x/21e6a04837/defense-video.zipURL to Archive of Advanced Monitoring Agenta.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/91e2f5fa2f/attachments.zipURL to Archive of Advanced Monitoring AgentAdditional IOCs regarding MuddyWater can be found in our GitHub page:https://github.com/deepinstinct/Israel-Cyber-Warfare-Threat-ActorsBack To BlogProductsPrevention PlatformPrevention for StoragePrevention for ApplicationsPrevention for EndpointsData Security: Powered by Deep InstinctDeep Learning: Prevention-First CybersecurityWhy Deep Instinct>99% Threat AccuracyPrevent RansomwarePrevent Zero-Day AttacksEnhance Existing Cyber ToolsExtend & Enhance EDR/XDR+ Microsoft Defender+ TaniumLegacy AVCompanyAbout Deep InstinctOur CustomersNewsroomCareersContact UsResourcesAsset LibraryBlogVideosEvents & WebinarsQuick linksRequest DemoCustomer PortalIntegrations and ComplianceTraining© 2024 Deep Instinct.
