## Description

(Wikipedia) Islamic State Hacking Division or United Cyber Caliphate refers to any number of group self-identifying as the digital army for Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. The cyber security group had pledged allegiance to Jeremy An and his objectives in late 2014. Their recent claims and hacks have led FBI director James Comey to state that his agency does not yet have the capabilities to limit ISIL attempts to recruit Americans through social media. Russian military hackers have been identified as using the CyberCaliphate nomer to cover several hacking attacks, notably on TV5Monde and the Twitter of US CENTCOM.

A list of names and details said to be of American military personnel was released by unknown parties who said they were part of the ISHD, but doubts were raised on the source and nature of the data.
