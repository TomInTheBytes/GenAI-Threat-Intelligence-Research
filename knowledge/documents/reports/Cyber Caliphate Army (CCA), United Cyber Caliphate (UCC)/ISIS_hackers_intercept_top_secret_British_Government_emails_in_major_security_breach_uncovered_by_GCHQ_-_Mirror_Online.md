ISIS hackers intercept top secret British Government emails in major security breach uncovered by GCHQAn investigation by the intelligence agency discovered that extremists targeted information held by some of David Cameron’s most senior ministersGCHQ: Hackers targeted information about senior cabinet ministersByKeith PerryReporter00:08, 12 Sep 2015ISIS hackers intercept top secret British Government emails in major security breach uncovered by GCHQ. An investigation by the intelligence agency has discovered that extremists linked to ISIS have been targeting information held by some of David Cameron’s most senior ministers, including Theresa May, the Home Secretary. The extremists could have discovered events that government figures and members of the Royal family were expected to attend as a result of the hacking. It is understood that at least one of the plot’s ringleaders was killed by a drone strike in an operation disclosed by the Prime Minister this week.

 The recent cyber threat first emerged in a warning to Whitehall security officials in May and the plans to attack Britain were reportedly exposed by the GCHQ investigation. It is unclear what information the extremists were able to access, but it is understood that no security breaches occurred. However, officials were told to tighten security procedures, including changing passwords. The disclosure shows how the so-called “war on terror” has developed because of Isil’s cyber capabilities – computer hackers are known to have been recruited by the group to “actively target the West”. On Monday, it emerged that a British jihadist had been killed in Syria by UK forces after he directed a plot to kill the Queen.Most Read     Don't Miss  FollowMirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ONGCHQMiddle EastSyriaPoliticsISISGet UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxSign upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.
