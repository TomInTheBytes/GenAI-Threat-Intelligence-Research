2015-10: Duuzer backdoor Trojan targets South Korea to take over computers
Symantec has found that South Korea is being impacted by an active back door Trojan, detected as Backdoor.Duuzer. While the malware attack has not been exclusively targeting the region, it has been focusing on the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer is a well-designed threat that gives attackers remote access to the compromised computer, downloads additional files, and steals data. It’s clearly the work of skilled attackers looking to obtain valuable information.
