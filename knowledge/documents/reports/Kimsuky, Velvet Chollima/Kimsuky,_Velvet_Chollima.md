## Description

(Kaspersky) For several months, we have been monitoring an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign against South Korean think-tanks. There are multiple reasons why this campaign is extraordinary in its execution and logistics. It all started one day when we encountered a somewhat unsophisticated spy program that communicated with its “master” via a public e-mail server. This approach is rather inherent to many amateur virus-writers and these malware attacks are mostly ignored.

While the government report stated that only 'non-critical' networks were affected, the attackers had demanded the shutdown of three reactors just after the intrusion. They also threatened 'destruction' in a message posted to Twitter.
