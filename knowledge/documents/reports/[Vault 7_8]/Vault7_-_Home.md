After Submitting

Tor
Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.
In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.
Tails
If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called Tails. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Tips
Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. 

1. Contact us if you have specific problems
If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please contact us. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.


2. What computer to use
If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use Tails to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.


3. Do not talk about your submission to others
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

1. Do not talk about your submission to others
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.


2. Act normal
If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.


3. Remove traces of your submission
If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.
In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.
If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.

4. If you face legal action
If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at https://www.couragefound.org.

Press Release
 
Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on
                        the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks,
                        it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.
The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents
                        and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's
                        Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley,
                        Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of
                        
                        CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the
                        2012 presidential election.
Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal
                        including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits,
                        malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This
                        extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred
                        million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity
                        of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former
                        U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner,
                        one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
"Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert
                        hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits
                        against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's
                        iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and
                        even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.
Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the
                        U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now
                        infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force
                        — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed
                        it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its
                        primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.
By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under
                        the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence
                        (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand
                        hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other "weaponized" malware. Such is
                        the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized
                        more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in
                        effect, its "own NSA" with even less accountability and without publicly
                        answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on
                        duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.
In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that
                        they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the
                        CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of
                        public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public
                        debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control
                        of cyberweapons.
Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world
                        in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.
Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that "There is an extreme
                        proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can
                        be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which
                        results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market
                        value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of "Year Zero" goes
                        well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure
                        is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."
Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the "Year Zero" disclosure and published
                        substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed'
                        cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political
                        nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed,
                        disarmed and published. 
Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some
                        identifying information in "Year Zero" for in depth analysis. These redactions
                        include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America,
                        Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results
                        of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that
                        the quantity of published pages in "Vault 7" part one (“Year Zero”)
                        already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three
                        years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.
Analysis
 
CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs
CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group),
                        a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department
                        belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of
                        the five major directorates of the CIA (see this 
                        organizational chart of the CIA for more details).
The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support
                        of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any
                        other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide.
The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons
                        with George Orwell's 1984, but "Weeping Angel", developed by the CIA's
                        Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests
                        smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic
                        realization.
The attack against Samsung smart TVs was
                        developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation,
                        Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the
                        owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode
                        the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending
                        them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.
As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at 
                        infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The
                        purpose        of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage
                        in nearly undetectable assassinations.
The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed 
                        numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected
                        phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text
                        communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone.
Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in
                        2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware
                        to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones
                        and other Apple        products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes
                        numerous local and remote "zero days"
                        developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber
                        arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may
                        be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political,
                        diplomatic and business elites.
A similar unit targets Google's Android which is
                        used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC
                        and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. "Year Zero"
                        shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 "weaponized"
                        Android "zero days" which it has developed itself and obtained from
                        GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors.
These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal,
                        Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the "smart" phones that they
                        run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.
 
CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers
The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control
                        Microsoft Windows users with its malware.
                        This includes multiple local and remote weaponized "zero days", air gap
                        jumping viruses        such as "Hammer Drill"
                        which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, 
                        infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to 
                        hide data in images or in covert disk areas (
                        "Brutal Kangaroo") and to keep its malware
                        infestations going.
Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's
                        Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has
                        developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA
                        malware, such as "Assassin" and "Medusa".
Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by
                        the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB).
The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control
                        systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such
                        as EDB's "HIVE" and the related "Cutthroat" and "Swindle" tools, which are
                        described in the examples section below.
 
CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities ("zero days")
In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry
                        secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose
                        on an ongoing basis — rather than hoard — serious vulnerabilities, exploits,
                        bugs or "zero days" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers.
Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of
                        the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber
                        criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA
                        can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.
The U.S. government's commitment to the 
                        Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology
                        companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived
                        hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive
                        vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis.
"Year Zero" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's
                        commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are
                        pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or
                        cyber criminals.
As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in "Year Zero" is able to penetrate,
                        infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run
                        presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed
                        security vulnerabilities ("zero days") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack
                        these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability.
                        As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who
                        make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable.
The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S.
                        Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers.
                        By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA
                        ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh at the expense of leaving everyone hackable.
 
'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk
Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control.
While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible
                        infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a
                        critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to
                        retain.
Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated
                        like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they
                        can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.
Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people
                        who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without
                        leaving traces — sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the
                        organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives
                        for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is
                        a global "vulnerability market" that will pay hundreds of thousands to
                        millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors
                        and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their
                        own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling
                        'hacking' services.
Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector,
                        which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and
                        their contractors, such as Booz Allan Hamilton, has been subject to
                        unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers.
A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named
                        have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in
                        separate incidents.
Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted
                        Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified
                        information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000
                        gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained
                        from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code
                        for numerous hacking tools.
Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world
                        in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers
                        alike.
 
U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base
In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the
                        U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering
                        Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate (
                        "Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe" or CCIE) are given diplomatic
                        ("black") passports and State Department cover. 
                        The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence
                        efforts appear inconsequential: "Breeze through German Customs because you have your
                        cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport"

Your Cover Story (for this trip)
Q: Why are you here?
A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate.
                        
Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to
                        customs and secondary
                        screening procedures.
Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border
                        checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open
                        border area — including France, Italy and Switzerland.
A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity.
                        These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are
                        disconnected from the internet, such as police record database.
                        In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under 
                        instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The
                        attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA
                        for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The
                        attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For
                        example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining,
                        provides 24 decoy applications for CIA
                        spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing
                        videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2,
                        2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while
                        the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically
                        infected and ransacked.
 
How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks
In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living
                        memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most
                        market valuable part of "Vault 7" — the CIA's weaponized malware (implants
                        + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems —
                        the agency has little legal recourse.
The CIA made these systems unclassified.
Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how
                        concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the
                        'battlefield' of cyber 'war'.
To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with
                        their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control
                        and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be
                        prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified
                        information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made
                        most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government
                        is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the
                        U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer
                        hackers can freely "pirate" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA
                        has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.
Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into
                        an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates
                        the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel
                        do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified
                        parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the
                        operator's intent.
Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly
                        dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For
                        instance, attempted "malware injections" (commercial jargon) or "implant
                        drops" (NSA jargon) are being called "fires" as if a weapon was being
                        fired. However the analogy is questionable.
Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live
                        for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does
                        not "explode on impact" but rather permanently infests its target. In
                        order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed
                        on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware
                        to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further
                        instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command & Control
                        (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are
                        typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command
                        and control systems are also made unclassified.
A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series
                        of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful
                        planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's
                        leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a
                        military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps
                        akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against
                        the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation
                        and exploitation.
 
Evading forensics and anti-virus
A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which
                        are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple,
                        Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus
                        companies attribute and defend against attacks.
"Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts" contains
                        CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints
                        implicating the "CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies" in
                        "forensic review". Similar secret standards cover the
                        
                        use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf),
                        describing targets & exfiltrated
                        data (pdf) as well as 
                        executing payloads (pdf) and 
                        persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time.
CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus
                        programs. These are documented in AV defeats,
                        Personal Security Products,
                        Detecting and defeating PSPs and
                        PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example,
                        Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing
                        itself in the Window's "Recycle Bin". While Comodo 6.x has a
                        "Gaping Hole of DOOM".
CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's "Equation Group" hackers did wrong
                        and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid
                        similar exposure.
 
Examples
 
The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains
                        around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by "Year Zero")
                        each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools.
The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for
                        penetration, infestation ("implanting"), control, and exfiltration.
Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation
                        of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to
                        communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to
                        target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs.
Some example projects are described below, but see 
                        the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks'
                        "Year Zero".
 
UMBRAGE
The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the
                        agency. Each technique it has created forms a "fingerprint" that can be used by
                        forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity.
This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate
                        murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is
                        responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find
                        likely attribution.
The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's
                        UMBRAGE group collects and maintains
                        a substantial library of attack techniques
                        'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.
With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its
                        total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving
                        behind the "fingerprints" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.
UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture,
                        data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus
                        (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques.
 
Fine Dining
Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case
                        officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB
                        (Operational Support Branch) to transform
                        the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks
                        (typically "exfiltrating" information from computer systems) for specific
                        operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing
                        tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration
                        staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the
                        relevant technical support staff.
Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason
                        Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign
                        Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent
                        is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked
                        to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer,
                        operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus
                        utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like
                        Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks
                        for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long
                        unobserved access to the computer can be maintained.  This information is
                        used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure
                        a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation.
 
Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE)
'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and
                        execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major
                        operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux
                        (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC
                        (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from
                        'Fine Dining' questionairies.
 
HIVE
HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control
                        software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris,
                        MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening
                        Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with
                        these implants.
The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a
                        cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover
                        domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains.
Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial
                        VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all
                        incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection
                        requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if
                        a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the
                        connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with
                        the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone
                        tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded
                        to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website.
The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an
                        operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so
                        the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant.
Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby
                        project.

                        See the classified user and
                        developer guides for HIVE.
 
Frequently Asked Questions
 
Why now?
WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready.
In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling
                        for a "Cyberwar" review to be prepared within 30 days.
While the review increases the timeliness and relevance
                        of the publication it did not play a role in setting the
                        publication date.
 
Redactions
Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in
                        the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis
                        is complete.

Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees,
                           contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for
                           example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are
                           used by the agency.
Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers)
                           to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the
                           redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one
                           assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person.
Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all
                           the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed
                           it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted.
Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the
                           content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been
                           infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be  
                           made available; until then the content is redacted.
The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including
                           more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible
                           targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, 
                           are redacted for further exclusive investigation.
Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent
                           accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries.

 
Organizational Chart
The organizational chart corresponds to the
                        material published by WikiLeaks so far.
Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of
                        Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches
                        within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information
                        contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as
                        a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the
                        reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur
                        frequently.
 
Wiki pages
"Year Zero" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the
                        internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called
                        Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system
                        (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights
                        on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page
                        histories for 1136 latest versions.
The order of named pages within each level is determined by date
                        (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally
                        dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the
                        re-constructed page).
 
What time period is covered?
The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level
                        is determined by date (oldest first).
WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for
                        each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually
                        the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page
                        order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks.
 
What is "Vault 7"
"Vault 7" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities
                        obtained by WikiLeaks.
 
When was each part of "Vault 7" obtained?
Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the 
                        other parts will be available at the time of publication.
 
Is each part of "Vault 7" from a different source?
Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication.
 
What is the total size of "Vault 7"?
The series is the largest intelligence publication in history.
 
How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of "Vault 7"?
Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them.
 
Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series?
No. That would be certainly counter-productive.
 
Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories?
No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage
                        others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent
                        parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic
                        excellence may be considered for early access to future parts.
 
Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me?
Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or
                        academics who are in a position to write them.
