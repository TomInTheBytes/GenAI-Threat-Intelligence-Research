Microsoft breach led to theft of 60,000 US State Dept emails

Chinese hackers stole tens of thousands of emails from U.S. State Department accounts after breaching Microsoft's cloud-based Exchange email platform in May.
During a recent Senate staff briefing, U.S. State Department officials disclosed that the attackers stole at least 60,000 emails from Outlook accounts belonging to State Department officials stationed in East Asia, the Pacific, and Europe, as Reuters first reported.
Additionally, the hackers managed to obtain a list containing all of the department's email accounts. The compromised State Department personnel primarily focused on Indo-Pacific diplomacy efforts.
"We need to harden our defenses against these types of cyberattacks and intrusions in the future, and we need to take a hard look at the federal government's reliance on a single vendor as a potential weak point," Senator Eric Schmitt said in a statement.
The reports were also confirmed by State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a press briefing on Thursday.
"Yes, it was approximately 60,000 unclassified emails that were exfiltrated as a part of that breach. No, classified systems were not hacked. These only related to the unclassified system," Miller told reporters.
"We have not made an attribution at this point, but, as I said before, we have no reason to doubt the attribution that Microsoft has made publicly. Again this was a hack of Microsoft systems that the State Department uncovered and notified Microsoft about."

Email breaches linked to Storm-0558 Chinese cyberspies
In July, Microsoft revealed that beginning on May 15, 2023, threat actors successfully breached Outlook accounts associated with approximately 25 organizations. The compromised organizations include the U.S. State and Commerce Departments and certain consumer accounts presumably linked to them.
Microsoft did not disclose specific details regarding the affected organizations, government agencies, or countries impacted by this email breach.
The company attributed the attacks to a cyber-espionage collective known as Storm-0558, suspected of being focused on obtaining sensitive information by infiltrating the email systems of their targets.
Earlier this month, Microsoft disclosed that the threat group first obtained a consumer signing key from a Windows crash dump, a breach facilitated after compromising the corporate account of a Microsoft engineer, which enabled access to the government email accounts.
The stolen Microsoft Account (MSA) key was employed to compromise Exchange Online and Azure Active Directory (AD) accounts by exploiting a previously patched zero-day validation vulnerability in the GetAccessTokenForResourceAPI. The flaw allowed the attackers to generate counterfeit signed access tokens, which allowed them to impersonate accounts within the targeted organizations.
In response to the security breach, Microsoft revoked the stolen signing key and, following investigations, found no additional instances of unauthorized access to customer accounts through the same method of access token forgery.
Under pressure from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Microsoft has also agreed to broaden access to cloud logging data at no cost, which would help network defenders identify potential breach attempts of a similar nature in the future.
Previously, such logging capabilities were exclusively accessible to customers with Purview Audit (Premium) logging licenses. Because of this, Microsoft faced criticism for impeding organizations from promptly detecting Storm-0558's attacks.

This comes with using any microsoft products/services, and really always has been as the most exploitable avenue to any honeypot. This is yet another example over time.

Still the most secure platform.

Still better that the state department's Secretary of State using a private email server in her home bathroom closet in order to thwart Freedom of Information Act requests by keeping those emails outside of the government system.

why are you politicizing a tech. announcement? This is not the place for it.

The title is misleading. It should be "60,00 email addreses". That's a big difference from "60,000 emails".

Unless they updated the article, what I'm reading is "at least 60,000 emails"... They obtained a list containing "all" the department's email accounts.

If you step back and look at the early reports of compromise, it was signing keys for core services. Like the certificate authority that everything else trusts. That means they granted themselves access, got access to any of the Fedramp Azure emails they wanted (at least, presuming Fedramp and Commercial are separate [doubt it]), and had raw server-level access to whatever they wanted from raw mailboxes to AzureAD access with it being so nicely integrated.
They had the a master key to make new keys to the house for all the friends essentially. What else could you want?
At that level you have to burn the house down to start over, I'd love to know what really transpired in Microsoft.
Microsoft Enterprise CA services have long-since been a well-known target for red teams with inherent insecurity and some excruciating measures to meaningfully secure that most (read: all) don't do. See https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy for an example. I'm sure Azure apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
