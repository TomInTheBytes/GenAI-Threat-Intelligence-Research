## Threat actor aliases

Nightshade Panda (CrowdStrike), APT 9 (Mandiant), Group 27 (ASERT), FlowerLady (Context), FlowerShow (Context)

## Description

(Softpedia) Arbor’s ASERT team is now reporting that, after looking deeper at that particular campaign, and by exposing a new trail in the group’s activities, they managed to identify a new RAT that was undetectable at that time by most antivirus vendors.

Named Trochilus, this new RAT was part of Group 27’s malware portfolio that included six other malware strains, all served together or in different combinations, based on the data that needed to be stolen from each victim.

This collection of malware, dubbed the Seven Pointed Dagger by ASERT experts, included two different PlugX versions, two different Trochilus RAT versions, one version of the 3012 variant of the 9002 RAT, one EvilGrab RAT version, and one unknown piece of malware, which the team has not entirely decloaked just yet.

2015-05: Chinese Actors Use ‘3102’ Malware in Attacks on US Government and EU Media

2016-09: From September 2016 through late November 2016, a threat actor group used both the Trochilus RAT and a newly idenfied RAT we’ve named MoonWind to target organizations in Thailand, including a utility organization. We chose the name ‘MoonWind’ based on debugging strings we saw within the samples, as well as the compiler used to generate the samples. The attackers compromised two legitimate Thai websites to host the malware, which is a tactic this group has used in the past.
