## Description

(Trend Micro) In this tech brief, we are going to expose a threat actor originating from China. Since the malware being used by the group, such as ShadowPad and Winnti, overlapped with other threat actors, its activities were attributed to other groups such as {{APT 41}}, Earth Baku, Sparkling Goblin, and the “Winnti” cluster in different reports. Our research reveals the different TTPs and the independent set of infrastructure that made us consider it a separate threat actor from the other known actors mentioned. Some reports named this threat actor “{{RedHotel, TAG-22}}” or “Fishmonger.” We decided to separate it from the Winnti umbrella and track this threat actor under the name “Earth Lusca.”
Our investigation of Earth Lusca started in mid-2021, when we discovered a campaign targeting customer service companies in China via a watering hole attack. Eventually, our monitoring and research lead to the publication of a blog post on a previously-unreported malware known as BIOPASS RAT. We continued monitoring the threat actor, eventually discovering a few more targeted operations against various targets worldwide. In this research, we will expose all of the groups TTPs and its current operations.
During our investigation, we also managed to reach some of the victims and gather interesting information from compromised servers that were used as watering holes. We were able to learn Earth Lusca’s reconnaissance and lateral movement techniques while working with our local incident response service team via our XDR system.
