    "# Threat Actor Report Summarizer\n",
    "This notebook summarizes all threat actor reports we have scraped and combines them into one file per threat actor. We can leverage these summaries for to improve LLM use cases, such as improving RAG performance through MultiVectorRetrievers and preventing token limits when using this information for other purposes with online LLMs. It uses OpenAI GPT3.5 for summarization. This notebook is built on top of the threat actor knowledge builder notebook.\n",

    "Provide a summary of the following activity/information report about a threat actor. It should not be longer than ten sentences. Make sure to include the region, operating sector and type of company of victims that were targeted if mentioned. Also focus on the evidence of the capability of the threat actor and the novelty of the tools and techniques used by the threat actor. Include the date and/or operation time window if included. Be concise and dry, as when writing an intelligence briefing. Focus on providing facts without bias. If the provided report seems to be empty, malformed, or wrongly retrieved, only output 'Malformed reporzt'.\n",

    "# Summarize reports per threat actor\n",
    "Create a markdown file with summaries of all reports per threat actor. We leverage OpenAI GPT3.5, which can cause issues with token limits per minute. Therefore, we sleep and retry up to 5 times when we catch an error. Some very long reports keep failing and won't be summarized. This will take a while, so it can resume where it left off when it fails or the process must be stopped because of some reason. Since we output the resulting markdown file immediately after summarizing all threat actor reports, we can check what reports we have already completed. "

       " AIMessage(content=\"Summary:\\nA threat actor named AeroBlade targeted an aerospace organization in the United States for commercial cyber espionage, using spear-phishing with weaponized documents containing remote template injection and VBA macro code. The attacker's network infrastructure became operational around September 2022, with the offensive phase occurring in July 2023. The attacker improved its toolset to make it stealthier, focusing on the aerospace industry in the U.S. The attack chain involved two phases, with the final payload being a reverse shell connecting to a C2 server on port 443. The threat actor displayed sophisticated technical capabilities, including anti-analysis techniques and encrypted static configuration, indicating a high level of expertise in cyber espionage. The attacker's interest in the target remained consistent between the two campaigns, showing a continuous effort to secure access to sensitive information. The threat actor's operations suggest a commercial cyber espionage campaign aimed at gaining visibility over internal resources for potential future ransom demands. The report provides detailed technical analysis of the attack vectors, weaponization, and network infrastructure used by the threat actor. The threat actor's identity remains unknown, but the development of their toolkit over time indicates a persistent and evolving threat.\")]"
