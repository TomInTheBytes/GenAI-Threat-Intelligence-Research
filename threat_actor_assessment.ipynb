Intent and Willingness\\n\\nBased on the provided reports, the threat actor known as Achilles demonstrates a clear intent to target high-value corporate internal networks, including those of multinational companies and government organizations. Their focus on private companies and government entities in the British Commonwealth, as well as their claimed access to networks like UNICEF, indicates a specific intent to target organizations within these sectors. Therefore, the intent score is:\\n\\nIntent Score: 4 (Sector + Regional Association)\\n\\nGiven the threat actor's ties to Iranian hackers and the potential connection to Iran based on activity following Iranian time zones, there may be some impact on their willingness to target a victim in Europe due to diplomatic and economic interactions. Therefore, the willingness modifier is:\\n\\nWillingness Modifier: -1 (Moderate impact)\\n\\nAdjusted Intent Score: 3 (Sector Association)\\n\\n### B. Capabilities and Novelty\\n\\nAchilles has demonstrated a significant capability to access high-value corporate networks, as evidenced by their claimed breaches of organizations like UNICEF, Symantec, and Comodo. The use of novel techniques such as living-off-the-land strategies and reliance on legitimate tools for intrusion showcases a credible capability to carry out sophisticated attacks. Therefore, the capability score is:\\n\\nCapability Score: 4 (Credible Capability)\\n\\nThe novelty of Achilles' methods, including the avoidance of malware and the focus on gaining access through RDP and VPNs, suggests a custom toolset and advanced skills. Therefore, the novelty modifier is:\\n\\nNovelty Modifier: -0 (Custom toolset for each campaign)\\n\\nAdjusted Capability Score: 4 (Credible Capability)\\n\\n## Threat Actor Evaluation Matrix\\n\\n| Dimension              | Score | Modifier | Adjusted Score |\\n|------------------------|-------|----------|----------------|\\n| Intent                 | 4     | -1       | 3              |\\n| Capability             | 4     | 0        | 4              |\\n\\n## Justification\\n\\nThe evaluation of the threat actor Achilles is based on their demonstrated intent to target specific sectors and regions, as well as their credible capability to access high-value corporate networks using novel techniques. The willingness modifier accounts for potential constraints on their targeting of a victim in Europe. Overall, Achilles poses a significant threat to organizations within the manufacturing industry in Europe, including the specified victim.\")"

    "-**Cyber-Crime:** Any attack intended for near-term financial profit (e.g., ransomware, point-of-sale (PoS) malware, etc). Intellectual Property (IP) theft that is not immediately sold is considered espionage rather than cyber-crime.  \n",
