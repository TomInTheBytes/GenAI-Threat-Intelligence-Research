    "# Threat Actor Knowledge RAG - ETDA Database\n",
    "This notebook is heavily inspired by the excellent research of Roberto Rodriguez (@Cyb3rWard0g) into the applicability of generative AI for threat intelligence purposes. It follows the same structure with small alterations for this specific use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In specific, this notebook describes how to query a vector database in QA fashion using Langchain and OpenAI. It uses the vector database built with the notebook in the 'knowledge' folder. This research shows that having a large set of reports does guarantee that simple similarity search through the vector database provides the chunks that we are looking for. A minor change in the original question can result in vastly different answers. The quality of the original data will be of great influence. Because we scraped a large number of reports and did not put in a lot of effort to check their quality, this will create noise in the context the LLM has to work with.\n",

The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is tracking this threat actor as AeroBlade. The actor used spear-phishing as a delivery mechanism: A weaponized document, sent as an email attachment, contains an embedded remote template injection technique and a malicious VBA macro code, to deliver the next stage to the final payload execution.\\n\\nEvidence suggests that the attacker’s network infrastructure and weaponization became operational around September 2022. BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the offensive phase of the attack occurred in July 2023. The attacker improved its toolset during that time, making it stealthier, while the network infrastructure remained the same.\\n\\nGiven the final payload functionality and the subject of the attack, BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the goal of this attack was commercial cyber espionage.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nAerospace\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nUSA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United States, and throughout Europe and Asia.\\n\\nOur analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template Injection. These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which ultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several related delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors used these TTPs throughout their attack campaign.\\n\\nInitially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the {{Gorgon Group}}. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs including the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators. Based on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.\\n\\nIn light of that, Unit 42 refers to the activity described in this blog as the Aggah Campaign based on the actor’s alias “hagga”, which was used to split data sent to the RevengeRAT C2 server and was the name of one of the Pastebin accounts used to host the RevengeRAT payloads.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage, Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nAutomotive, Education, Government, Healthcare, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Media, Retail, Technology\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in',\n",

At least some UNC3944 threat actors appear to operate in underground communities, such as Telegram and underground forums, which they may leverage to acquire tools, services, and/or other support to augment their operations. This activity overlaps with activity that has been reported in open sources as '0ktapus,' 'Scatter Swine,' and 'Scattered Spider.' Since 2022 and through early 2023, UNC3944 appeared to focus on accessing credentials or systems used to enable SIM swapping attacks, likely in support of secondary criminal operations occurring outside of victim environments. However, in mid-2023, UNC3944 began to shift to deploying ransomware in victim environments, signaling an expansion in the group's monetization strategies. These changes in their end goals signal that the industries targeted by UNC3944 will continue to expand; Mandiant has already directly observed their targeting broaden beyond telecommunication and business process outsourcer (BPO) companies to a wide range of industries including hospitality, retail, media and entertainment, and financial services.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nWorldwide\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\",\n",

One of the most interesting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS.

Symantec has monitored this group’s activities for the last three years as they have consistently targeted a number of industries. Interesting highlights in their method of operations include: the use of seemingly an unlimited number of zero-day exploits, attacks on supply chain manufacturers who service the target organization, and a shift to “watering hole” attacks (compromising certain websites likely to be visited by the target organization). The targeted industry sectors include, but are not restricted to; defense, various defense supply chain manufacturers, human rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers. These attackers are systematic and re-use components of an infrastructure we have termed the “Elderwood platform”. The name “Elderwood” comes from a source code variable used by the attackers. This attack platform enables them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through spear phishing emails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering hole attacks.',\n",

Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails.  Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.

While {{Naikon, Lotus Panda}} shares some characteristics with APT 30, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches.\\n\\n(FireEye) When our Singapore-based FireEye labs team examined malware aimed predominantly at entities in Southeast Asia and India, we suspected that we were peering into a regionally focused cyber espionage operation. The malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targets—government and commercial—who hold key political, economic, and military information about the region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005.\\n\\nBased on our knowledge of APT30’s targeting activity and tools, their objective appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example, credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials). Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks.\\n\\nThe group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN meetings.\\n\\nMany of APT30’s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India, border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets —who typically work on related issues—to click on the attachments and infect themselves.',\n",
       "  'In addition to APT30’s Southeast Asia and India focus, we’ve observed APT30 target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for the Chinese Communist Party’s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position themselves to shape public messaging.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Government\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nASEAN, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nBackBend, Backspace, Creamsicle, Flashflood, Gemcutter, Milkmaid, NetEagle, Orangeade, Shipshape, Spaceship\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.\\n\\nAPT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.\\n\\nAPT 33 seems to be closely related to {{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}} since at least 2017.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage, Sabotage and destruction\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nAviation, Defense, Education, Energy, Financial, Government, Healthcare, High-Tech, Manufacturing, Media, Petrochemical, others\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nIran, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, UK, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

Activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely state-sponsored activity. This is remarkable because explicit financially motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests these two motivations were balanced concurrently from 2014 onward.\\n\\nAPT41 overlaps at least partically with public reporting on group including {{Barium}} and {{Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda}}. In some cases the primary observed similarity in the publicly reported Winnti activity was the use of the same malware – including HIGHNOON – across otherwise separate clusters of activity.\\n• Previous FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting on the use of HIGHNOON and related activity was grouped together under both {{Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon}} and Mana, although we now understand this to be the work of several Chinese cyber espionage groups that share tools and digital certificates.\\n• APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was previously reported as GREF, as well as additional indicators and activity gathered during our extensive review of our intelligence holdings.\\n\\nAPT 41 has 1 subgroup:\\n1. {{Subgroup: Earth Longzhi}}\\n\\nAlso see {{Earth Lusca}} and {{RedGolf}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime, Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in',\n",

The group’s operations, which are designed to build trust and rapport with their victims, have included accessing the personal and corporate email accounts of government officials, former Iranian policymakers or political figures, members of the Iranian diaspora and opposition groups, journalists, and academics who are involved in research on Iran. After gaining access, the group has deployed mobile malware capable of tracking victim locations, recording phone conversations, accessing videos and images, and extracting entire SMS inboxes.\\n\\nAPT42 has a demonstrated ability to alter its operational focus as Iran’s priorities evolve over time. We anticipate APT42 will continue to conduct cyber espionage operations in support of Iran’s strategic priorities in the long term based on their extensive operational history and imperviousness to public reporting and infrastructure takedowns.\\n\\nThe full published report covers APT42’s recent and historical activity dating back to at least 2015, the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, targeting patterns, and elucidates historical connections to {{Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Illusion, Charming Kitten}}.

CTU researchers associate this activity with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim’s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim’s files. The consistent tools and behaviors associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics.

While Microsoft constantly tracks a number of activity groups with varying degrees of Russian government affiliation, the emergence of a novel GRU affiliated actor, particularly one which has conducted destructive cyber operations likely supporting broader military objectives in Ukraine, is a notable development in the Russian cyber threat landscape. A month before Russia invaded Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard foreshadowed future destructive activity when it created and deployed WhisperGate, a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs), against Ukrainian government organizations. Cadet Blizzard is also linked to the defacements of several Ukrainian organization websites, as well as multiple operations, including the hack-and-leak forum known as “Free Civilian”.\\n\\nMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022. We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present. Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas. Cadet Blizzard’s operations, though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard, are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations.

More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.\\n\\nThis targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances. While we don’t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.\\n\\nWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.\\n\\nIt is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently available information.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Government, Think Tanks, journalists\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nEurope and the South Caucasus\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nRCS Galileo',\n",

It also refers to malware of the same name (Carbanak). It is sometimes referred to as {{FIN7}}, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.\\n\\n(Kaspersky) From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits website traffic that related to financial activity.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime, Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nUkraine\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEnergy, Financial, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare, Hospitality\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Luxembourg, Morocco, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK, Ukraine, USA, Uzbekistan\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39’s targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\\n\\nAPT39’s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making.

The attackers employed two methods. They acquired domains that imitate legitimate ones. In addition, the APT group placed SSL certificates that also imitated legitimate ones on its servers.

We believe these attacks originated from the same threat actor – Chimera – as  these attacks utilized similar tactics, techniques and even the same customized malware. The actor likely harvested various valid credentials via phishing emails or data breaches as their starting point to conduct their cyber attack on the vendors. Cobalt Strike was later used as their main RAT tool. To avoid detection, the Cobalt Strike RAT was often masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update. The RAT would then connect back to their C2 server. As these servers were in a public cloud server, it made it difficult to track. Subsequently, by compromising the AD server, the delicate malware – SkeletonKeyInjector – was invoked to implant a general key to allow LM, persistence and defense evasion. Although this malware was discovered for the first time, we have high confidence that these attacks were conducted by the same threat actor. Based on the stolen data, we infer that the actor’s goal was to harvest company trade secrets.

As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\\n\\n(Yahoo) In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing Obama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive — known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 — the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.\\n\\nFormer officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.\\n\\nThis more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA’s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as “Vault 7” (see {{[Vault 7/8]}}.)

It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.\\n\\nLonghorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally.\\n\\nLonghorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.\\n\\nFor C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored, CIA\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nUSA\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in',\n",

After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups’ operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note –most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\\n\\nBelow are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:\\n• Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym (“The people whose lips are stitched and sealed” –translation from Persian) –In this channel attack tools attributed to the group ‘{{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}}’ were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the Technion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.\\n• Green Leakers–In this channel attack tools attributed to the group ‘{{MuddyWater, Seedworm, TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten}}’ were leaked. The group’s name and its symbol are identified with the “green movement”, which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\\n• Black Box–Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of confidential documents labeled as “secret” (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest –top secret) were posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups’ activity.

US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware.\\n\\nThe malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitations. They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims’ machines.\\n\\nCovellite’s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization known as {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} by Novetta and Hidden Cobra by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nLazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017.

Interestingly, these targets include Kurdish and Turkish natives and ISIS supporters. Most interesting of all, though, is that all these targets are actually Iranians citizens.\\n\\nConsidering the nature of the target, the data collected about these groups provides those behind the campaign with highly valuable information that will no doubt be leveraged in further future action against them.

The theme may allow the network traffic to fly under the radar.\\n\\nThe actors use false personas to register their domains instead of opting for privacy protection services.  Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen as another cost control measure.  The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly alter a legitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used accurate spelling, possibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos included.

Because of a self-destruct mechanism built into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands.\\n\\nA long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group’s extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include:\\n• The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm Belgacom.\\n• The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer’s registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches of a computer’s Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using antivirus software.\\n• Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition, infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised both iOS and OS X devices.\\n• The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure.\\n• USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which are so sensitive that they aren’t connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps.\\n• An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution.',\n",

Although it has been active over a large timespan, the group has mostly operated under the radar and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been covered by security researchers. It only recently attracted attention when a lure document was uploaded to VirusTotal and was brought to public knowledge by researchers on Twitter. Subsequently, one of its implants was analyzed by a Chinese intelligence firm. We have been able to expand some of the findings on the group and provide insights on additional variants. The malware dropped from the aforementioned document is dubbed MarkiRAT and is used to record keystrokes and clipboard content, provide file download and upload capabilities as well as the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s machine. We were able to trace the implant back to at least 2015, along with variants intended to hijack the execution of the Telegram and Chrome applications as a persistence method. Interestingly, some of the TTPs used by this threat actor are reminiscent of other groups operating in the domain of dissident surveillance. For example, it used the same C2 domains across its implants for years, which was witnessed in the activity of {{Domestic Kitten}}. In the same vein, the Telegram execution hijacking technique observed in this campaign by Ferocious Kitten was also observed being used by {{Rampant Kitten}}, as covered by Check Point.

The group specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.\\n\\nFIN4 has targeted over 100 companies since at least mid-2013. All of the targeted organizations are either public companies or advisory firms that provide services to public companies (such as investor relations, legal, and investment banking firms). Over two-thirds of the targeted organizations are healthcare and pharmaceutical companies.

They had valid user credentials to remotely log into the network,” said Barry Vengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. “No sexy zero-days, no remote exploits – not even spear-phishing. They had credentials from somewhere.”\\n\\nFIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has been in action since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim organization’s virtual private network, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC.

Based on near parallel TTPs used by the attacker(s) across these targeted intrusions, we believe these clusters of activity are linked to a single, previously unobserved actor or group that we have dubbed FIN10.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nCasinos and Gambling, Mining\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nCanada, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nEmpireProject, KOMPROGO\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.\\n\\nNotably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}, but we do not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is complicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated actors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime, Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Education, Energy, Financial, Hospitality, Retail, Telecommunications, Technology, Transportation\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nWorldwide\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

They are also the first FIN actor that we are promoting who specializes in a specific phase of the attack lifecycle—ransomware deployment—while relying on other threat actors for gaining initial access to victims.

The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. “Armagedon” (spelled incorrectly) was found in the “Last Saved By” and “Author” fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine’s decision to accept the Ukraine-\\xad‐European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia’s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn’t start until much later (mid‐2013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement.\\n\\nRussian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: “Changing Ukraine in a Changing World: Factors of Success.”\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored, FSB 16th & 18th Centers\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin',\n",

In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan institutions.  The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information.\\n\\n(UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama’s Private Office\\nThe OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a courtesy telephone call, the diplomat’s office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting. The Tibetans wondered whether a computer compromise might be the explanation; they called ONI Asia who called us.

Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and self-modifying destructive malware.\\n\\nWe are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack – “Hades”. We have previously emphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that, the attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} APT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader, we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.\\n\\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer attack bear a certain resemblance to {{Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit}} APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However, it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a master in the use of false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored, GRU\\n\\nMotivation: Sabotage and destruction, Financial crime\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nRussia\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nFinancial, Government, Healthcare\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in',\n",

Targets include individuals in strategic positions: Executives in important businesses such as oil, finance and engineering, military officers, embassy personnel and government officials. The Inception attacks began by focusing on targets primarily located in Russia or related to Russian interests, but have since spread to targets in other locations around the world.

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking  rojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.\\n\\nIn August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.\\n\\nIndrik Spider appears to be a subgroup of {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}.

Now, due to operational errors—a basic misconfiguration—by suspected ITG18 associates, a server with more than 40 gigabytes of data on their operations has been analyzed by X-Force IRIS analysts.\\n\\nRarely are there opportunities to understand how the operator behaves behind the keyboard, and even rarer still are there recordings the operator self-produced showing their operations. But that is exactly what X-Force IRIS uncovered on an ITG18 operator whose OPSEC failures provide a unique behind-the-scenes look into their methods, and potentially, their legwork for a broader operation that is likely underway.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Government, Pharmaceutical\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nUSA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\n2020-05: During a three-day period in May 2020, IBM X-Force IRIS discovered the 40 GBs of video and data files being uploaded to a server that hosted numerous ITG18 domains used in earlier 2020 activity.

As opposed to typical cybercrime, the group likely conducts well-planned, disciplined, and methodical cyber operations more akin to careful espionage activities. Their malicious cyber operations have netted hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and are likely a major source of funding for the North Korean regime. The group has always used a calculated approach, which allows them to sharpen their tactics, techniques, and procedures while evading detection. Over time, their operations have become increasingly complex and destructive. The tools and implants employed by this group are consistently complex and demonstrate a strong focus on effectiveness and operational security.\\n\\nNorth Korea's intelligence apparatus controls a hacking team dedicated to robbing banks through remote internet access. To differentiate methods from other North Korean malicious cyber activity, the U.S. Government refers to this team as BeagleBoyz, who represent a subset of HIDDEN COBRA activity. The BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity industry as {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} and {{Subgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima}} and are responsible for the FASTCash ATM cash outs reported in October 2018, fraudulent abuse of compromised bank-operated SWIFT system endpoints since at least 2015, and lucrative cryptocurrency thefts. This illicit behavior has been identified by the United Nations (UN) DPRK Panel of Experts as evasion of UN Security Council resolutions, as it generates substantial revenue for North Korea. North Korea can use these funds for its UN-prohibited nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Additionally, this activity poses significant operational risk to the Financial Services sector and erodes the integrity of the financial system.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nNorth Korea\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nFinancial\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\",\n",

The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems.\\n\\n(Dragos) Analysis of Raspite tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. Raspite targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.\\n\\nRaspite leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. Raspite uses the same methodology as {{Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0}} and {{Allanite}} in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to Raspite –controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEnergy, Financial, Government, Transportation\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nIsrael, Kuwait, Lebanon, USA, Europe and East Asia\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nImecab, LaZagne, Mimikatz, PhpSpy, Sorgu\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

The actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China’s naval modernization effort. The group has specifically targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More recently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

We believe both attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan), which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018 elections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope’s interest in the U.K. engineering company they targeted dates back to attempted intrusions in May 2017.\\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-threat-actor-tempperiscope/',\n",

LightBasin’s focus on Linux and Solaris systems is likely due to the combination of critical telecommunications infrastructure running on those operating systems, in addition to the comparatively lax security measures and monitoring solutions on Linux/Solaris systems that are typically in place on Windows operating systems within an organization.\\n\\nLightBasin managed to initially compromise one of the telecommunication companies in a recent CrowdStrike Services investigation by leveraging external DNS (eDNS) servers — which are part of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network and play a role in roaming between different mobile operators — to connect directly to and from other compromised telecommunication companies’ GPRS networks via SSH and through previously established implants.

The attackers use very simple malware, which required little development time or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware.  The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP).\\n\\nThe vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.\\n\\nThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on the part of the victims.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:',\n",

Typically, they will handpick a set of targets that in turn are handled with almost surgical precision, with infection vectors, malicious implants and payloads being tailored to the victims’ identities or environment. It’s not often we observe a large-scale attack conducted by actors fitting this profile, usually due to such attacks being noisy, and thus putting the underlying operation at risk of being compromised by security products or researchers.\\n\\nWe recently came across unusual APT activity that exhibits the latter trait – it was detected in high volumes, albeit most likely aimed at a few targets of interest. This large-scale and highly active campaign was observed in South East Asia and dates back to at least October 2020, with the most recent attacks seen around the time of writing. Most of the early sightings were in Myanmar, but it now appears the attackers are much more active in the Philippines, where there are more than 10 times as many known targets.\\n\\nFurther analysis revealed that the underlying actor, which we dubbed LuminousMoth, shows an affinity to the {{Mustang Panda, Bronze President}} (HoneyMyte) group. This is evident in both network infrastructure connections, and the usage of similar TTPs to deploy the Cobalt Strike Beacon as a payload. In fact, our colleagues at ESET and Avast recently assessed that HoneyMyte was active in the same region. The proximity in time and common occurrence in Myanmar of both campaigns could suggest that various TTPs of HoneyMyte may have been borrowed for the activity of LuminousMoth.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nMyanmar, Philippines\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nCobalt Strike\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

It all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was able to interact automatically with the financial institution’s remote banking service (RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself.\\n\\nIn 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed in order to start stealing the cash. Russia’s banking system, like those of many other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to exploit the security gap.\\n\\nSo we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way: it didn’t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its name. To “lurk” means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush.\\n\\nWe were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk. This time we got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular structure.\\n\\nLater discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of development.

Additionally, some possible timestomping muddies the water between this operation possible originating in 2008-2009 or actually coming into full force in 2010-2013 (the latter dates being corroborated by VT firstseen submission times and second-stage drop timestamps). There’s a level of variable developmental capability visible throughout the stages. Multiple components are abused commonly-available resources, while the orchestrator and two of the DLL drops actually display some developmental ingenuity (in the form of seemingly novel COM techniques). Far from the most advanced coding practices but definitely better than the sort of .NET garbage other ‘Farsi-speaking’ APTs have gotten away with in the past.\\n\\nSomehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA’s radar pre-2013. As far as I can tell, it’s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for the disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this cluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes overlapping with EQGRP implants. Submissions of Nazar subcomponents from Iran (as well as privately shared visibility into historical and ongoing victimology clustered entirely on Iranian machines) could support that theory. Perhaps this is an internal monitoring framework (a la Attor) but given the sparse availability of historical data, I wouldn’t push that beyond a low-confidence assessment, at this time.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nDistribute.exe, EYService, GpUpdates.exe, Microolap Packet Sniffer\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations.\\n\\nAttackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system. To deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company’s defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies’ networked computers.\\n\\nNight Dragon may be related to {{APT 18, Dynamite Panda, Wekby}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEnergy, Oil and gas, Petrochemical\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nGreece, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Taiwan, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nASPXSpy, Cain & Abel, gsecdump, zwShell\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

The threat group is notable because it employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a backdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The group can maintain a low profile probably because the VBScripts are small and stealthy in their execution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to detect because the VBScripts are encoded and the actors employ SSL network communications. We have observed intermittent activity from this group since we first identified it in 2013, and we saw a spike in activity during mid-2015.\\n\\nWe assess that one of the probable targets of the group’s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian government, based on the specificity of some of the decoy documents.\\n\\nIn addition to the anti-analysis techniques, the group has used SSL communications since we first identified this activity in 2013.

FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.

Zimbra is an open source email platform often used by organizations as an alternative to Microsoft Exchange.\\n\\nThe campaigns came in multiple waves across two attack phases. The initial phase was aimed at reconnaissance and involved emails designed to simply track if a target received and opened the messages. The second phase came in several waves that contained email messages luring targets to click a malicious attacker-crafted link. For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker's link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser. The link itself, however, could be launched from an application to include a thick client, such as Thunderbird or Outlook.

The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.\\n\\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims’ banking accounts or through selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300 employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEducation, Engineering, Industrial, Manufacturing, IT, Pharmaceutical, Shipping and Logistics, Tourism and Trading\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAzerbaijan, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Gibraltar, India, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, UAE, UK, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nOpGhoul\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

A hired actor is consistent with our findings on the Command and Control servers related to this campaign, which included web-based control panels for multiple RATs, suggesting that several campaigns were being run at once. A hired actor may also explain the generic and uninspired nature of the phishing, which often took the form of an email purporting to contain an invoice or a legal document with an attachment containing a blurry image.

The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.\\n\\nOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).\\n\\nWith deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.\\n\\nAn overlap has been found between Operation Parliament and {{Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Education, Energy, Financial, Government, Healthcare, Media, Research, Shipping and Logistics, Telecommunications, Sports\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in',\n",

In 2020, the group used Manuscrypt in attacks on defense enterprises in different countries.

One specific case of the PseudoManuscrypt downloader’s distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet (whose main installer is also distributed via the pirated software installer distribution platform). This means that the malware distribution tactics used by the threat actor behind PseudoManuscrypt demonstrate no particular targeting.\\n\\nDuring the period from January 20 to November 10, 2021, Kaspersky products blocked PseudoManuscrypt on more than 35,000 computers in 195 countries of the world.

McAfee has detected the malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic BackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may recognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel to the infected machine).\\n\\nMcAfee has gained access to one specific Command & Control server used by the intruders. We have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log collection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time but that is the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were standard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit is sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit when opened on an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute and initiate a backdoor communication channel to the Command & Control web server and interpret the instructions encoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code. This will be quickly followed by live intruders jumping on to the infected machine and proceeding to quickly escalate privileges and move laterally within the organization to establish new persistent footholds via additional compromised machines running implant malware, as well as targeting for quick exfiltration the key data they came for.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored, PLA Unit 61398',\n",

Pinchy Spider sells access to use GandCrab ransomware under a partnership program with a limited number of accounts.

Its activities are distinctly different not only from those typically seen in untargeted attacks, but from many targeted attacks as well. A large share of targeted attacks can be characterized as opportunistic: the activity group changes its target profiles and attack geographies based on geopolitical seasons, and may attack institutions all over the world. Like many such groups, Platinum seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, but its range of preferred targets is consistently limited to specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligence agencies, diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. The group’s persistent use of spear-phishing tactics (phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals) and access to previously undiscovered zero-day exploits have made it a highly resilient threat.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Financial, Government, Telecommunications, Intelligence agencies\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nChina, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nadbupd, AMTsol, DvDupdate.dll, JPIN, psinstrc.ps1, RedPepper, RedSalt, Titanium, Living off the Land\\n\\nReported hacking operations',\n",

The links led to code designed to exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages. This campaign was carried out by what appears to be a single operator that we call POISON CARP.\\n• We observed POISON CARP employing a total of eight Android browser exploits and one Android spyware kit, as well as one iOS exploit chain and iOS spyware. None of the exploits that we observed were zero days. POISON CARP overlaps with two recently reported campaigns against the Uyghur community. The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called “Evil Eye” reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.\\n• POISON CARP appears to have used Android browser exploits from a variety of sources. In one case, POISON CARP used a working exploit publicly released by Exodus Intelligence for a Google Chrome bug that was fixed in source, but whose patch had not yet been distributed to Chrome users. In other cases, POISON CARP used lightly modified versions of Chrome exploit code published on the personal GitHub pages of a member of Qihoo 360’s Vulcan Team, a member of Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab, and by a Google Project Zero member on the Chrome Bug Tracker.\\n• This campaign is the first documented case of one-click mobile exploits used to target Tibetan groups, and reflects an escalation in the sophistication of digital espionage threats targeting the community.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage',\n",

They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections.

This series of suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity groups prior to this campaign.\\n\\nThese network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition to the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose predecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018 agreement.\\n\\nThe suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s September 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission and its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source for both monitoring the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its position on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.\\n\\nWhile there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as {{Mustang Panda, Bronze President}} (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as RedDelta:\\n• The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.\\n• The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.',\n",

From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future’s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power sector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included 2 Indian seaports.\\n\\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including {{APT 41}} and {{Tonto Team, HartBeat, Karma Panda}}.\\n\\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular campaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.\\n\\nAlso see {{TAG-38}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEnergy, Maritime and Shipbuilding\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nShadowPad Winnti\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAustralia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czech, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, UAE, UK, USA, Worldwide\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nAvaddon\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\n2020-06: New Avaddon Ransomware launches in massive smiley spam campaign\\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-avaddon-ransomware-launches-in-massive-smiley-spam-campaign/\\n\\n2020-07: Avaddon ransomware shows that Excel 4.0 macros are still effective\\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shows-that-excel-40-macros-are-still-effective/\\n\\n2020-08: Avaddon ransomware launches data leak site to extort victims\\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-launches-data-leak-site-to-extort-victims/',\n",

Usually, the attackers deliver some of the tracking and system/browser identification and evercookie capabilities.

A trend that we have seen unfold before our eyes lately is these cybercriminals’ use of simple backdoors to gain a foothold in their targets’ networks. Once they have this access, a lot of the work is done manually, slowly getting to understand the network layout and deploying custom tools the criminals can use to steal funds from these entities. Some of the groups that best exemplify these trends are {{Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider}}, {{Cobalt Group}} and {{Corkow, Metel}}.\\n\\nThe group discussed in this white paper is part of this new trend. We call this new group RTM; it uses custom malware, written in Delphi, that we cover in detail in later sections. The first trace of this tool in our telemetry data dates back to late 2015. The group also makes use of several different modules that they deploy where appropriate to their targets. They are interested in users of remote banking systems (RBS), mainly in Russia and neighboring countries.\\n\\nThat this group is mostly targeting businesses is apparent from the processes they are looking for on a compromised system.

It is an emerging and active targeted threat.\\n\\nWhile we have yet to determine the campaign’s total number of victims, it appears that nearly 12,000 unique IP addresses spread over more than 100 countries were connected to two sets of command-and-control (C&C) infrastructures related to Safe. We also discovered that the average number of actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day. This indicates that the actual number of victims is far less than the number of unique IP addresses. Due to large concentrations of IP addresses within specific network blocks, it is likely that the number of victims is even smaller and that they have dynamically assigned IP addresses, which have been compromised for some time now.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEducation, Government, Media, NGOs, Technology\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAlgeria, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Egypt, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Korea, South Sudan, Syria, UAE, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nDebugView, LZ77, OpenDoc, Safe, TypeConfig, UPXShell, UsbDoc, UsbExe, an MS Office 0-day exploit\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

Next, the implant, which can perform in several different modes, typically will install itself as a service and then begin beaconing out to an adversary-controlled host.\\n3.

This group has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group’s motivations appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and {{Putter Panda, APT 2}}, it has not been concluded that the groups are the same.\\n\\n(Palo Alto) The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.\\n\\nThe attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.\\n\\nScarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities.

The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems.\\n\\nThe actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nTurkey\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nAerospace, Defense, Energy, Government, NGOs, Telecommunications, Think Tanks, Intelligence agencies\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAlbania, Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Netherlands, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey, UAE, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nDrupalgeddon, DNS hijacking\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\n2018-01: Talos now has moderate confidence that the threat actors behind Sea Turtle have been using another DNS hijacking technique.

Mabna Institute earned the moniker 'Silent Librarian' due to its focused efforts to compromise university students and faculty by impersonating university library resources using domain shadowing to harvest credentials.\\n\\nHowever, while RiskIQ's findings are consistent with TTPs in use by Silent Librarian, they alone are not sufficient to attribute the threat activity we've detected against these 20 universities directly to Mabna Institute.

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing systems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation.

Since then, ShaggyPanther activity has been detected in several more locations: most recently in Indonesia in July, and – somewhat surprisingly – in Syria in March. The newer 2018 and 2019 backdoor code maintains a new layer of obfuscation and no longer maintains clear-text C2 strings. Since our original release, we have identified an initial server-side infection vector from this actor, using SinoChopper/ChinaChopper, a commonly used web shell shared by multiple Chinese-speaking actors. SinoChopper not only performs host identification and backdoor delivery but also email archive theft and additional activity. Although not all incidents can be traced back to server-side exploitation, we did detect a couple of cases and obtained information about their staged install process.

While referencing a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director’s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English\\xadlanguage proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common right\\xadto\\xadleft filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension. All of these techniques, while common pretexting mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would eventually be successful.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nThis group targets Iranians in diaspora\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nLuminosity RAT, Sima\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors have historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of hypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines (VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate legacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to increase the impact against a victim.\\n\\nAll identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four separate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to log in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely used the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter administrator credentials stored in a web browser.\\n\\nBy targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple systems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi server inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware on each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also improve the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional operating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent or detect ransomware attacks.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime, Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEducation, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Technology\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nCobalt Strike, Defray777, LaZagne, Metasploit, PyXie, SharpHound, Shifu, SystemBC, Vatet\\n\\nReported hacking operations',\n",

The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel. Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.\\n\\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control. We also identified other bait content employed by this threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were directly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the UAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, “UAE” in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared to be operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in relation to their Twitter activity.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nUAE\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nCivil society groups and Emirati journalists, activists and dissidents\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nNetherlands, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, UAE, UK\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

Storm-0558 pursues this objective through credential harvesting, phishing campaigns, and OAuth token attacks. This threat actor has displayed an interest in OAuth applications, token theft, and token replay against Microsoft accounts since at least August 2021. Storm-0558 operates with a high degree of technical tradecraft and operational security. The actors are keenly aware of the target’s environment, logging policies, authentication requirements, policies, and procedures.

Based on our research, SWEED — which has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans.\\n\\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a myriad of different types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a packed version of Agent Tesla — an information stealer that’s been around since at least 2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from what we’ve seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the system.

       "  '2018-01: In early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based droppers. Similar to previous campaigns, the JAR was directly attached to emails and used file names such as “Order_2018.jar”. The purpose of the JAR was to obtain information about the infected system and facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla.\\n\\n2018-04: In April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office exploit.

In May 5, 2011 the Syrian Computer Society registered SEA’s website (syrian-es.com). Because Syria's domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written that the group was supervised by the Syrian state.

As soon as May 27, 2011 SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity.

The lures entice users to click a link in the message, taking them to the legitimate Microsoft third-party apps consent page. There they are prompted to grant a third-party application read-only user permissions to their O365 account via OAuth2 or other token-based authorization methods. TA2552 seeks access to specific account resources like the user’s contacts and mail. Requesting read-only permissions for such account resources could be used to conduct account reconnaissance, silently steal data, or to intercept password reset messages from other accounts such as those at financial institutions.

Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting COVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against established and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a phishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance on COVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have dubbed “Sepulcher”. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic affairs.  Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to historic Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads linked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020 targeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher malware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked to historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT malware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint researchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously been documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413’s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020 before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.\\n\\nAn overlap in infrastructure has been observed with {{Lucky Cat}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nTibet, Europe\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

These campaigns originated from adversary-operated free email sender accounts at yahoo[.]co[.].jp and yahoo[.]com. Sender addresses often imitated common names found in the languages of targeted entities. Spear phishing emails included malicious .doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file extensions.\\n\\nThe lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content in several cases utilized information technology themes specific to Asia such as governmental or public training documents relating to IT. On one specific occasion an email utilized the subject “ITU Asia-Pacific Online CoE Training Course on ‘Conformity & Interoperability in 5G’ for the Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019” and the attachment name “190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&i.doc”. The conference referenced in the lure was an actual event likely selected due to its relevance to potential victims.

One of these SLDCs was also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest set of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting of power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity group. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and co-opted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control (C2) of Shadowpad malware infections, as well as use of the open source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP).\\n\\nDespite a partial troop disengagement between India and China from February 2021, the prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure continues to raise concerns over pre-positioning activity being conducted by Chinese adversaries. While this latest activity displays targeting and capability consistencies with previously identified {{RedEcho}} activity, there are also some notable distinctions.

Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.\\n\\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background.\\n\\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers’ activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nGovernment\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nBrazil, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nDripion, Taidoor\\n\\nReported hacking operations',\n",

The attack is carried out by Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored actor based in China that typically focuses on espionage and information gathering. Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that this Volt Typhoon campaign is pursuing development of capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises.\\n\\nVolt Typhoon has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted critical infrastructure organizations in Guam and elsewhere in the United States. In this campaign, the affected organizations span the communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education sectors. Observed behavior suggests that the threat actor intends to perform espionage and maintain access without being detected for as long as possible. Microsoft is choosing to highlight this Volt Typhoon activity at this time because of our significant concern around the potential for further impact to our customers. Although our visibility into these threats has given us the ability to deploy detections to our customers, the lack of visibility into other parts of the actor’s activity compelled us to drive broader community awareness and further investigations and protections across the security ecosystem.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nConstruction, Education, Government, Industrial, IT, Maritime and Shipbuilding, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Transportation, Utilities\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nAustralia, India, UK, USA\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nFRP, Impacket, Living off the Land\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\n2021-06: Chinese Cyberespionage Group BRONZE SILHOUETTE Targets U.S. Government and Defense Organizations\\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/chinese-cyberespionage-group-bronze-silhouette-targets-us-government-and-defense-organizations',\n",

After further investigation, Dragos observed WASSONITE tools and behaviors targeting multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities including electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and organizations involved in space-centric research. WASSONITE has been active since at least 2018.\\n\\nWASSONITE targeting focuses on Asian entities, largely in India, as well as possibly Japan and South Korea. At this time, WASSONITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive capability. All the activity represents Stage 1 ICS kill-chain: access operations within IT networks.\\n\\nWASSONITE operations rely on deploying DTrack malware for remote access to victim machines, capturing credentials via Mimikatz and publicly available tools, and utilizing system tools to transfer files and move laterally within the enterprise system. Researchers first disclosed DTrack in late September 2019, and identified the tool targeting Indian financial institutions and research centers. DTrack is loosely connected to an earlier observed malware family, ATMDTrack, used for robbing ATM machines.\\n\\nThird-party security firms associate DTrack and its related malware to the {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}}. Dragos also associates the activity group {{Covellite}} to Lazarus Group. However, while COVELLITE is also linked to broader Lazarus activity, this group leveraged substantially different capabilities and infrastructure to pursue a target set that does not overlap with observed WASSONITE activity.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nNorth Korea\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nEnergy, Oil and gas, Manufacturing, Research\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nDtrack, Mimikatz\\n\\nReported hacking operations',\n",

Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks.\\n\\nButterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target.\\n\\nThis group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information.

The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also expanded the scope of its targeting. Some reporting suggests a number of other groups, including {{APT 41}}, {{Axiom, Group 72}}, {{APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda}}, and {{Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon}}, are closely linked to or overlap with Winnti Group.\\n\\n(Trend Micro) The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing malware.\\n\\nThe group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing self-developed technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to illicitly farm in-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The group has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor: State-sponsored\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nChina\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in',\n",

It emerged that the piece of malware landed on users’ computers as part of a regular update from the game’s official update server. Some even suspected that the publisher itself was spying on players.

DomainTools initially publicized the group in early 2021, naming it based on an initial command-and-control beacon URL string “wintervivern,” which is no longer in use. Subsequently, Lab52 shared additional analysis several months later, identifying new activity associated with Winter Vivern.\\n\\nThe group has avoided public disclosure since then, until recent attacks targeting Ukraine. A part of a Winter Vivern campaign was reported in recent weeks by the Polish CBZC, and then the Ukraine CERT as UAC-0114. In this activity, CERT-UA and the CBZC collaborated on the release of private technical details which assisted in our research to identify a wider set of activity on the threat actor, in addition to new victims and previously unknown specific technical details. Overall, we find that the Winter Vivern APT is a resource-limited but highly creative group that shows restraint in the scope of their attacks. Our analysis indicates that Winter Vivern activity aligns closely with global objectives that support the interests of Belarus and Russia’s governments.\\n\\nAlso see {{MoustachedBouncer}}.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Government\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nIndia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, Tunisia, Ukraine, USA, Europe\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nAPERETIF\\n\\nReported hacking operations',\n",

WIP26 is characterized by the abuse of public Cloud infrastructure – Microsoft 365 Mail, Microsoft Azure, Google Firebase, and Dropbox – for malware delivery, data exfiltration, and C2 purposes.\\n\\nThe WIP26 activity is initiated by precision targeting of employees through WhatsApp messages that contain Dropbox links to a malware loader. Tricking employees into downloading and executing the loader ultimately leads to the deployment of backdoors that leverage Microsoft 365 Mail and Google Firebase instances as C2 servers. We refer to these backdoors as CMD365 and CMDEmber, respectively. The main functionality of CMD365 and CMDEmber is to execute attacker-provided system commands using the Windows command interpreter.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nTelecommunications\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nMiddle East\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nCMD365, CMDEmber\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

It is considered unsophisticated by the fact that the scripts are unobtrusive, communications go unencrypted by HTTP, they use Powershell (increasingly monitored), and so on. Despite this apparently unsophisticated modus operandi compared to other actors, they manage to infect their victims and carry out their objectives. In addition, as will be seen during the report, the detection rate of some of the scripts in December 2018 by the main antivirus manufacturers is low, an aspect that must be highlighted. We must be aware that once these scripts are executed, it is when the behavior analysis of many solutions will detect them, but this fact has not been studied by LAB52.\\n\\nThis actor in all the artifacts analyzed shows his victims a decoy document in Arabic with different themes.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Middle East]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nDefense, Government, diplomats\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nMiddle East\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nEmpireProject, H-Worm, Living off the Land, several VBScript, PowerShell and VBA scripts\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

In the interim, the group compromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present our analysis of this nine-year-long espionage campaign, active since 2011, but which apparently went dark in February 2020.\\n\\nWith its primary purpose seemingly being cyber espionage, this group stole documents and other sensitive files, such as victims’ mailboxes. These outcomes were achieved through the use of the XDSpy malware ecosystem, composed of at least seven components: XDDown, XDRecon, XDList, XDMonitor, XDUpload, XDLoc and XDPass. As our research has not uncovered links with any previously known APT groups, we have attributed this malware toolset to a previously unknown group.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nGovernment\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nBelarus, Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nChromePass, IE PassView, MailPassView, Network Password Recovery, OperaPassView, PasswordFox, Protected Storage PassView, XDDown, XDList, XDLoc, XDMonitor, XDPass, XDRecon, XDUpload\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\nReported counter operations against threat actor',\n",

Several custom tools were later downloaded to the system in order to carry out post-exploitation activities. All of these tools appear to have been created by the same developer. We were able to collect several variations of these tools including one dating back to July 2018.\\n\\nThe developer of the collected tools used character names from the anime series Hunter x Hunter, which is the basis for the campaign name “xHunt.” The names of the tools collected include backdoor tools Sakabota, Hisoka, Netero and Killua. These tools not only use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels, but certain variants of these tools use DNS tunneling or emails to communicate with their C2 as well. While DNS tunneling as a C2 channel is fairly common, the specific method in which this group used email to facilitate C2 communications has not been observed by Unit 42 in quite some time. This method uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) and stolen credentials to create email “drafts” to communicate between the actor and the tool. In addition to the aforementioned backdoor tools, we also observed tools referred to as Gon and EYE, which provide the backdoor access and the ability to carry out post-exploitation activities.\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Information theft and espionage\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\nIran\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nShipping and Logistics\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nKuwait\\n\\nObserved usage of tools',\n",

And while banking Trojans or targeted attacks are quite specific in what they do, information stealers are by far less discriminatory and thus end up affecting a greater number of people and organizations.\\n\\nThat brings us to CoreBot, a new information stealer discovered and analyzed by IBM Security X-Force researchers, who indicate this is one malware piece to watch out for.

The malware’s compiled file was named “core” by its developer. Antivirus engines do not specify this malware’s name yet and detect it under generic names such as Dynamer!ac or Eldorado.

Notably, none were custom-made. The entire toolset was based on publicly available open-source instruments used for pentesting purposes. After examining the toolset in more detail, it became clear that the tools were most likely associated with a threat actor executing one of the oldest attack methods: SQL injections.\\n\\nWhile delving deeper into the malicious infrastructure, Group-IB researchers identified the threat actor’s first targets, predominantly linked to the gambling industry. This prompted the Threat Intelligence unit to name the threat actor GambleForce (tracked under the name EagleStrike GambleForce in Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence Platform). Since it appeared in September 2023, GambleForce has targeted more than 20 websites (government, gambling, retail, and travel) in Australia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, South Korea, Thailand, and Brazil.\\n\\nDespite using very basic attack methods, the threat actor has managed to successfully attack six companies in Australia (travel), Indonesia (travel, retail), the Philippines (government), and South Korea (gambling), which shows just how vulnerable many organizations are against rudimentary but clearly dangerous SQL injection attacks.\\n\\nIn some instances, the attackers stopped after performing reconnaissance. In other cases, they successfully extracted user databases containing logins and hashed passwords, along with lists of tables from accessible databases. Rather than looking for specific data, the threat actor attempts to exfiltrate any available piece of information within targeted databases, such as hashed and plain text user credentials.

The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments – an allegation it has consistently denied.\\n\\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data – including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code – leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future.\\n\\nFollowing the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company’s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team’s resumed operations came six months later – a new sample of Hacking Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team’s shareholding.

First observed in mid-2014, this malware shared code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, Mummy Spider swiftly developed the malware’s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture.\\n\\nMummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.\\n\\nAfter a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.\\n\\nMummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers.\\n\\nEmotet has been observed to distribute BokBot ({{Lunar Spider}}), Dridex ({{Indrik Spider}}), DoppelPaymer ({{Doppel Spider}}), Zeus Panda ({{Bamboo Spider, TA544}}) and Trickbot ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}), as well as QakBot ({{Mallard Spider}}).\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial crime\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]',\n",

The redirection led to the installation of Trojanized applications named facebook.apk and chrome.apk that contained Android Trojan-Banker. According to our telemetry data, this malware was detected more than 6,000 times, though the reports came from just 150 unique users (from February 9 to April 9, 2018). Of course, this is down to the nature of the malware distribution, but it also suggests a very painful experience for some users, who saw the same malware appear again and again in their network. More than half of the detections were observed targeting the Asian region.\\n\\nDuring our research we received some invaluable information about the true scale of this attack. There were thousands of daily connections to the command and control (C2) infrastructure, with the device locale for the majority of victims set to Korean. Since we didn’t find a pre-existing name for this malware operation, we decided to assign a new one for future reference.

It’s the first time a second-stage downloader has made the list, and may indicate a coming shift in the threat profiles of typical malware attacks.\\n\\nSmoke Loader has been observed to distribute DoppelPaymer ({{Doppel Spider}}), TinyLoader ({{Tiny Spider}}), DanaBot ({{Scully Spider, TA547}}), BokBot ({{Lunar Spider}}), Zeus Panda ({{Bamboo Spider, TA544}}) and TrickBot ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}).\\n\\nSponsor type and motivation\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nMotivation: Financial gain\\n\\nCountry of origin\\n\\n[Unknown]\\n\\nObserved attacked sectors where victims operate in\\n\\nObserved attacked countries where victims operate in\\n\\nWorldwide\\n\\nObserved usage of tools\\n\\nSmoke Loader, Sasfis\\n\\nReported hacking operations\\n\\n2015: Smoke Loader – downloader with a smokescreen still alive\\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/08/smoke-loader-downloader-with-a-smokescreen-still-alive/\\n\\n2018-04: Smoke Loader malware improves after Microsoft spoils its Campaign\\nhttps://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/774/smoke-loader-malware-improves-after-microsoft-spoils-its-campaign\\n\\n2018-06: Smoking Guns - Smoke Loader learned new tricks\\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/smoking-guns-smoke-loader-learned-new.html',\n",

Approximately three years later, Hancitor remains a threat and has evolved to use tools like Cobalt Strike. In recent months, this actor began using a network ping tool to help enumerate the Active Directory (AD) environment of infected hosts.

SchwartzJune 17, 20135 Min ReadThe Syrian Electronic Army: 9 Things We Know(click image for larger view)The Syrian Electronic Army: 9 Things We Know Who\\'s launching online attacks against your network? How can you better detect those attacks and -- if an attack turns out to be successful -- identify what was stolen?Enabling businesses to answer those questions is the premise of a cloud-based service announced Tuesday by security startup CrowdStrike. Dubbed Falcon, the big-data \"active defense platform\" is designed to identify intrusions in real time, attribute attacks – correlate with a known group of attackers – and help businesses block attacks or even engage in counterintelligence or deception by feeding attackers fake information.\"This is the real-time damage assessment that no one is doing today,\" said Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and CTO of CrowdStrike, speaking by phone. \"It shows you who the adversary is, what did they do [on your network], what did they take, which commands did they execute?\" The service works in part by running a small (400 KB) \"sensor\" on Windows 7 and Mac OS X systems, bolstered',\n",
       "  'is, what did they do [on your network], what did they take, which commands did they execute?\" The service works in part by running a small (400 KB) \"sensor\" on Windows 7 and Mac OS X systems, bolstered by DNS, email and API sensors on servers, to track the types of attacks that are being launched. CrowdStrike then correlates attack information with intelligence that the company gathers on attack groups.[ NSA whistleblower\\'s accusations deepen. Read Snowden Says U.S. Hacking Chinese Civilians Since 2009. ]As highlighted by successful spear-phishing attacks against everyone from security giant RSA to the White House, stopping every last information security attack might be impossible. So-called advanced persistent threat (APT) groups often use fake emails and attachments to infect targeted PCs and steal data, oftentimes without end users or security teams being aware. Once attackers infect a single PC, unless they\\'re detected, they can lurk in corporate networks indefinitely: telecommunications giant Nortel was compromised for 10 years, defense contractor QinetiQ for three years.Such attacks are cheap to build and inexpensive to launch. Even if only one attack out of every 100 or 1,000 attempts succeeds, that might equal success for attackers. Given that reality, CrowdStrike\\'s play is to help businesses identify not just when they\\'ve been attacked, but also who stole the information, what they stole and why they targeted the business in the first place -- what\\'s their bigger goal?\"The problem you\\'ve had for the past six to seven years is the emergence of targeted attackers, and for them, it doesn\\'t mater how many layers of defense you put in place; what they want is you,\" said Alperovitch. \"They want money, national secrets, intellectual property, and they\\'re going to worm their way in, because the return on that investment is gigantic.\"Could defenders gain an edge by better understanding their attackers? \"From an adversary perspective, we really focus on the targeted attackers,\" said Alperovitch. \"We\\'re tracking lots of nation-state-sponsored groups that are working to penetrate companies,\" he said, and \"understanding their campaigns, and tradecraft, as well as who they\\'re targeting.\"CrowdStrike has grouped attackers into \"adversary groups\" -- to date, about 48 in total -- named for country characteristics: \"pandas\" for groups operating from China; \"cats\" as in Persian cats for Iran;',\n",
       "  'targeting.\"CrowdStrike has grouped attackers into \"adversary groups\" -- to date, about 48 in total -- named for country characteristics: \"pandas\" for groups operating from China; \"cats\" as in Persian cats for Iran; \"bears\" for Russia; \"saints\" for Georgia; and \"tigers\" for India. \"Some in the community refer to the adversary by the malware detection name from a specific antivirus vendor, e.g. Hydraq,\" said Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at CrowdStrike, in a blog post, referring to the name of the malware used in the so-called Aurora attacks against Google. \"This is sometimes useful, but when the adversary is using a malware that is detected as Generic.Downloader.234, you have a much harder time communicating,\" Meyers said.CrowdStrike recommends that businesses use its intelligence on online adversaries to identify and focus on the attackers they\\'re most likely to face. \"For example, if you\\'re in the financial service industry, you\\'ll care about Big Panda, which is going after financial services firms, but not Karma Panda that\\'s going after dissident groups,\" said Alperovitch. \"If you\\'re trying to go after everyone and defend against everything, you\\'re really defending against nothing.\"For instance, one group that CrowdStrike has been tracking -- dubbed Anchor Panda -- has launched 124 attacks over the past six months, many of which appear to be aimed in part at building out deep-sea capabilities. Adam Meyers, head of intelligence for Crowdstrike, recently told The New Yorker that the information being targeted by the group bears more than a passing resemblance to China\\'s five-year plan for modernizing its infrastructure.Once businesses have identified the group behind an attack, or used new intelligence to identify previously unidentified attacks that were successful as well as what was stolen, what happens next? According to Alperovitch, \"if you want to work with the government, we can help with that as well, on our services side,\" which is headed by Shawn Henry, whose prior job was serving as the executive assistant director of the FBI\\'s criminal, cyber, response and services branch. \"Or you take the attribution and take legal action against that individual or the company,\" he said. \"A lot of companies are multinationals, so you can actually sue them in the United States -- or in a jurisdiction of your choosing overseas, and get criminal damages or injunctive',\n",
       "  'legal action against that individual or the company,\" he said. \"A lot of companies are multinationals, so you can actually sue them in the United States -- or in a jurisdiction of your choosing overseas, and get criminal damages or injunctive relief for stolen information.\"Alperovitch said that when it comes to responding to hack attacks, there can be strength in numbers: \"If you\\'re one company going up against China, you\\'re going to be afraid of retaliation, of your business being shut out of China. But if you\\'re in a band of 20 or 30 Fortune 100 companies, China can\\'t really retaliate; it needs them all.\"\"Ultimately we\\'ll only solve this problem together, not individually trying to build castles to protect ourselves,\" said Alperovitch. \"That model hasn\\'t worked in the physical world in over 400 years, and certainly not in cyber space.\"About the Author(s)Mathew J.

       "  'What were the most interesting developments in terms of APT activity throughout the year and what can we learn from them?\\nNot an easy question to answer; everybody has partial visibility and it’s never possible to really understand the motivations of some attacks or the developments behind them. Still, with the benefit of hindsight, let’s try to approach the problem from different angles to get a better understanding of what went on.\\nOn big actors\\nThere are a few ‘traditional’ actors that are very well known to the security community and that everybody has been tracking for the last few years. It has been business as usual for these actors in 2018 or, if anything, perhaps slightly quieter than usual.\\nIn reality, it is the doctrines and modi operandi of these groups that determine how they react in the event of their operations becoming public knowledge. Some actors will simply abort their campaign and go into clean-up mode, while others carry on as normal. In order to do so, it is common for some of these actors to simultaneously work on several sets of activity. This allows them to compartmentalize operations, and if they are discovered, they simply improve their toolset to avoid detection next time.\\nWe traditionally find many Russian-speaking actors in this second group, and we would like to highlight the 2018 activity of Sofacy, Turla and CozyBear.\\nSofacy was probably the most active of the three. Throughout the year we detected it in various operations, updating their toolset and being blamed by authorities for several past operations. We have seen the actor deploying Gamefish and an updated version of its DealersChoice framework against embassies and EU agencies. One of the most high-profile incidents was abuse of Computrace LoJack by this actor in order to deploy its malware on victim machines, in what can be considered a UEFI-type rootkit.\\nZebrocy is one of the tools traditionally used by this actor, but in reality the collection of cases where this tool was used can be considered a subset of activity in its own right. We saw different improvements for Zebrocy’s subset, including a new custom collector/downloader, new VBA implementing anti-sandboxing techniques and new .NET modules.',\n",
       "  'During the year we understood that Sofacy appears to be changing at a structural level and is possibly already being split into different subgroups. With the OlympicDestroyer analysis we learnt that this highly sophisticated false flag operation was somehow related to Sofacy. However, we later observed more activity by the OlympicDestroyer subset in Europe and Ukraine, and it was then that we decided to treat it as the entity we call Hades.\\nOf particular interest is how, after the publication of the GreyEnergy set of activity that is believed to be a continuation of BlackEnergy/Sandworm, we found additional overlaps between GreyEnergy and Zebrocy, including the use of the same infrastructure and the same 0-day for ICS.\\nAll that seems to link this new Hades actor with the Zebrocy subset of activity, traditionally attributed to Sofacy, as well as part of the BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy/Sandworm cluster.\\nRegarding Turla, we didn’t spot any big structural changes like those described above, though we did see this actor using some interesting implants such as LightNeuron (targeting Exchange servers as described in our previous APT summary for Q2), as well as a new backdoor that, according to ESET, infected Germany’s Federal Foreign Office in 2017, as well as other entities in the European Union.\\nWe discovered this actor using a new variant of its Carbon malware in its traditional activity of targeting embassies and foreign affairs institutions throughout the year. It also started using a new framework that we call Phoenix, as well as (unsurprisingly) transitioning to scripting and open source tools for its lateral movement stage.',\n",
       "  'Finally, some potential CozyDuke activity was detected during November 2018, apparently targeting diplomatic and governmental entities in Europe. The TTPs do not seem to be those that are usually attributed to this actor, which opened the door to speculation about this malware being used by a different group. The facts still seem to confirm that the malware used is attributable to CozyDuke. We are still investigating this new campaign by an actor that has been inactive for months.\\nIt’s also worth mentioning Lazarus and BlueNoroff activity in 2018. We observed constant activity from this group targeting different regions including Turkey, other parts of Asia and Latin America, as well as various lines of business that provide it with financial gain, such as casinos, financial institutions and cryptocurrencies. In its more recent campaigns it has started deploying a new malware we call ThreatNeedle.\\nOn false flags\\nIt comes as no surprise to find false flags every now and again, sometimes implemented rather naively. But this year we witnessed what should be considered (so far) the mother of all false flags (more details can be found here). Other than the technical details themselves, what is also worth considering is the real purpose of this attack, and why these sophisticated false flags were planted in the malware.\\nThe first obvious conclusion is that attackers now understand very well what techniques are used by the security industry to attribute attacks, so they have abused that knowledge to fool security researchers. Another consideration is that the main objective of an attack is not necessarily related to stealing information or disrupting operations – imitating an attacker might be more important.\\nThis may actually be part of what some actors are doing at the moment. There are several groups that were apparently inactive for some time but now appear to be back. However, they are using different TTPs that are not necessarily better. As we shall see later, a couple of examples may be CozyDuke and APT10. As a purely speculative thought, it might be that their traditional toolset is now being used by different groups, maybe still related to the original operators. The purpose might be to make attribution more difficult in the future, or simply to distract from their real ongoing operations.',\n",
       "  'The whole OlympicDestroyer story eventually resulted in the discovery of a new subset of activity related to both Sofacy and BlackEnergy that we call Hades. We will see how these more sophisticated false flags evolve in the future and how they are used to pursue less explicit goals.\\nOn the forgotten ones\\nThroughout the year we also saw how several old ‘friends’ re-emerged from hibernation with new sets of activity. Here we are talking about several well-known actors that for unknown reasons (a lack of visibility might be one of them) didn’t display much activity in recent times. However, it seems they are back. In some cases they appear in different weaker forms, perhaps with different operators, or just pretending not to be in shape while they run other parallel operations; in others cases they are back with their usual capabilities.\\nWe can summarize all this by dividing it up into the regions that showed most activity during the year. First place went to South East Asia, followed by the Middle East.\\nFor South East Asia we can point to groups such as Kimsuky that developed a brand new toolset at the very beginning of the year, or activity that falls under the always difficult-to-attribute WinNTI ‘umbrella’. However, and most notably, we can highlight groups such as DarkHotel, LuckyMouse, or even APT10.\\nThe OceanSalt campaign was attributed to APT10, though it’s not very clear how strong the connection is. It seems unlikely that this actor, after the public disclosure and so many years of no known activity, would return with anything that might be attributable to them. At the moment, this is difficult to assess.\\nLuckyMouse, the second Chinese-speaking group from this list, was very active all year. It hacked national data centers to deploy watering-hole attacks against high-profile victims in central Asia, used a driver signed by a Chinese security-related software developer, and is even suspected of being behind attacks against Oman immediately after the signing of a military agreement with India.',\n",
       "  'Scarcruft used a new backdoor we call PoorWeb, deployed a 0-day in their campaign at the beginning of the year and used Android malware specially designed for Samsung devices. DarkHotel was also back with a 0-day and new activity, targeting their traditional victims. We were able to establish a connection with a medium level of certainty between DarkHotel and the Konni/Nokki set of activity described by other vendors.\\nAPT10 was especially active against Japanese victims, with new iterations of its malware, as was OceanLotus, which actively deployed watering holes targeting high-profile victims in South Asia with a new custom stager.\\nIn the Middle East we observed groups such as Prince of Persia re-emerge with some activity, along with OilRig. We also detected new MuddyWaters activity, as well as GazaTeam, DesertFalcons and StrongPity among others deploying various campaigns in the region.\\nOn the new kids\\nAt the same time many new sets of activity emerged during the year that were also focused primarily on the Middle East and South East Asia.\\nThis activity was driven by Asian actors such as ShaggyPanther, Sidewinder, CardinalLizard, TropicTrooper, DroppingElephant, Rancor, Tick group, NineBlog, Flyfox and CactusPete – all of them active in the region throughout the year. As a rule, these groups are not that technically advanced, using a variety of approaches to achieve their objectives. They are usually interested in regional targets, with their main objectives being governmental and also military.',\n",
       "  'In the Middle East we saw activity by LazyMerkaats, FruityArmor, OpParliament, DarkHydrus and DomesticKitten among others. Sets of activity such as that by the Gorgon group are a bit of an exception as they also target victims outside the region.\\nFinally, we also detected new sets of activity that show an apparent interest in eastern European countries and former Soviet republics. In this group we find DustSquad, ParkingBear and Gallmaker. The latter seems to be interested in overseas embassies as well as military and defense targets in the Middle East.\\nOn the big fishes\\nEven if some of the activity previously described doesn’t seem that technically advanced, it doesn’t mean it isn’t effective. Looking back we can cite a few public cases where it looks like these attacks are returning to the days when attackers were after major strategic research or blueprints that might be of the interest to state-sponsored groups, and not just some random data.\\nWe have several examples. For instance, APT15 was suspected of targeting a company providing services to military and technology departments of the UK government. Intezer provided extra details about the activity of this group, though it is not clear who the ultimate victim was.\\nTEMP.Periscope was suspected of hacking maritime organizations related to the South China Sea. It wasn’t the only case in which the industry was targeted, as later it was discovered an unknown actor attacked companies related to Italian naval and defense industries.\\nGroups such as Thrip showed a clear interest in targeting satellite communication companies and defense organizations in the US and South East Asia.\\nFinally, the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center was attacked, according to the Washington Post, by a group linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security, resulting in the theft of 614GB of data and blueprints.\\nThe re-emergence of some of these groups and their victims don’t seem to be a coincidence. Some observers might even see the return of these big targeted attacks as the end of some sort of tacit agreement.\\nWe also observed several attacks against journalists, activists, political dissidents and NGOs around the world. Many of these attacks involved malware developed by companies that provide surveillance tools to governments.',\n",
       "  'We also observed several attacks against journalists, activists, political dissidents and NGOs around the world. Many of these attacks involved malware developed by companies that provide surveillance tools to governments.\\nFor instance, NSO and its Pegasus malware was discovered in more than 43 countries according to an external investigation, showing that business in this field is blooming. On a darker note, there were reports on how Saudi dissidents and Amnesty International volunteers were targeted with this malware.\\nThe Tibetan community was also specifically targeted with different malware families, including a Linux backdoor, PowerShell payloads, and fake social media to steal credentials.\\nFinally, CitizenLab provided details of a campaign where Sandvine and GammaGroup artifacts were used for surveillance through local ISPs in Egypt, Turkey and Syria.\\nOn naming and shaming\\nThis is clearly a new strategy, adopted as a defense mechanism and as a response to the attackers, in some cases being justice able to claim individual working for APT groups. This can later be used in diplomatic offensives and lead to tougher consequences at the state level. It seems that governments are no longer shy of making these attacks public and providing details of their investigations, while pointing fingers at the suspected attackers. This is an interesting development and we will see how it evolves in the future.\\nThe end of the Obama-era cyber-agreement between the US and China could be the reason for the wave of Chinese-speaking groups making a comeback, as well as the targeting of some of the high-profile ‘big fishes’ described above. We saw how in this new period of hostility between the two countries, the US obtained the extradition from Belgium of a Chinese intelligence officer charged with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and steal trade secrets from multiple US aviation and aerospace companies.',\n",
       "  'The US also provided details about a North Korean citizen suspected of being part of the Lazarus group that was behind the Sony Entertainment attack and WannaCry activity, and who is now wanted by the FBI. Maybe in an unrelated note, the US Cert was very active during the year in providing indicators of compromise and detailing Lazarus (HiddenCobra) activity and the tools used by this actor.\\nAfter the infamous DNC hack, the US indicted 12 Russian citizens belonging to units 26165 and 74455 of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate. Seven officers of GRU were also indicted for their alleged role in a campaign to retaliate against the World Anti-Doping Agency that exposed the Russian state-sponsored doping program.\\nIn Europe, UK Officials and the UK National Cyber Security Center attributed the not-Petya attack that took place in June 2017 to Russian military units.\\nFinally, and in a very interesting initiative, the US Cyber Command launched an ‘information warfare’ campaign with a message to Russian operatives not to even try influencing the US mid-term election process.\\nAll the above, and several other cases, shows how there seems to be a new doctrine in dealing with such hacking attempts, making them public and providing tools for media campaigns, future negotiations and diplomacy, as well as directly targeting operatives.\\nOn hardware\\nThe closer malware gets to the hardware level, the more difficult it is to detect and delete. This is no easy task for the attackers, as it’s usually difficult to find the exploit chain to get that deep in the system, along with the difficulty in developing reliable malware working in such deep levels. That always raises the question of whether this malware already exists, quietly abusing modern CPU architecture characteristics, and we simply don’t see it.\\nRecent discoveries of vulnerabilities in different processors open the door to exploits that might be around for years, because replacing the CPU is not something that can be easily done. It is not clear yet how Meltdown/Specter and AMDFlaws among others might be exploited and abused in the future, but attackers don’t really need to rush as these vulnerabilities will probably be around for a long time. Even if we haven’t see them being exploited in the wild yet, we believe this is a very valuable piece of knowledge for attackers and maybe also a timely reminder for us all about how important hardware security is.',\n",
       "  'That leads on to something we actually saw in the VPNFilter attack, in this case targeting networking devices on a massive scale. This campaign, attributed to a Russian-speaking set of activity, allowed attackers to infect hundreds of thousands of devices, providing control of the network traffic as well as allowing MITM attacks. We saw APT actors abusing network devices in the past but never in such an aggressive way.\\nOn other stuff\\nTriton/Trisis is an industrial-targeting set of activity that gained popularity during the year as it was discovered in some victims, and is suspected of shutting down an oil refinery in an attack where the actor used a 0-day. According to FireEye, this actor might have Russian origins.\\nIn our predictions we already discussed the possibility of destructive attacks becoming normal in situations where tensions exist between two adversaries, using collateral victims to cause harm and send messages in this dangerous grey zone between an open attack and diplomacy.\\nFinancial attackers may not be using very new techniques, but that may be because they don’t need to. The Carbanak group was ‘beheaded’ with the arrest in Spain of one of their leaders; however, that doesn’t seem to have had any impact on subsequent Fin7 activity during the year. They deployed their new Griffon JavaScript backdoor targeting restaurant chains. Meanwhile, a suspected subset of this group – the CobaltGoblin group – was also very active targeting banks in a more direct way.',\n",

This campaign has been active since at least May 2019, and targets an Asian religious and ethnic group.\\nThe threat actor’s unsophisticated but creative toolset has been evolving a lot since the inception date, may still be in development, and leverages Sojson obfuscation, NSIS installer, Python, open-source code, GitHub distribution, Go language, as well as Google Drive-based C2 channels.\\nThe threat actor’s operational target is not clear because, unfortunately, we haven’t been able to observe many live operations, and we couldn’t identify any overlap with known intrusion sets.\\nThou shalt update plugins: attack synopsis\\nThe watering holes have been set-up on websites that belong to personalities, public bodies, charities and organizations of the targeted group. At the time of writing, some of these websites (all hosted on the same server) are still compromised, and continue to direct selected visitors to malicious payloads:\\n\\nDomain\\nDescription\\n\\ncorps.org\\nVoluntary service program\\n\\nct.org\\nReligious personality’s charity\\n\\npolicy.net\\nPolicy institute\\n\\nche.com\\nReligious personality\\n\\nparliament.org\\nPublic body\\n\\nialwork.org\\nCharity\\n\\nnature.net\\nEnvironmental conservation network\\n\\nairtrade.com\\nFair trade organization',\n",
       "  'Upon visiting one of the watering hole websites, a previously compromised but legitimately embedded resource will load a malicious JavaScript. It’s hosted by one of the water-holed websites, and gathers information on the visitor. An external server (see Fig. 1) then ascertains whether the visitor is a target.\\nFig. 1. Target validation service request.\\nIf the visitor is validated as a target, the first JavaScript stage will load a second one, which in turn will trigger the drive-by download attack, showing a fake update pop-up (see Fig. 2).\\nFig. 2. Warning generated by the second payload.\\nThe visitor is then expected to fall into the update trap, and download a malicious installer package that will set up a backdoor.\\nFor nothing is hidden that will not come to light: technical analysis \\n1st JavaScript stage\\nThe first JavaScript stage is named (script|jquery)-css.js, and is obfuscated with the Chinese-language web service Sojson, version 4 (see Fig. 3).\\nFig. 3. Sojson v4 JavaScript obfuscated one-liner.\\nThe payload leverages the RTCPeerConnection API and ipify service to fingerprint visitors. The gathered data is sent to loginwebmailnic.dynssl[.]com through HTTP GET requests, in order to validate the visitor as a target: \\nhttps://loginwebmailnic.dynssl[.]com/all/content.php?jsoncallback=&lanip=&wanip=&urlpath=&_=\\nThe JSON-formatted response, whose only key is “result”, can either be “t” or “f” (true or false). If the value is “f”, then nothing happens, while “t” will trigger the second JavaScript stage (see Fig. 4).\\nFig. 4. First stage deobfuscated validation logic.\\nIn a previous version of this first JavaScript script, an additional JavaScript payload was unconditionally loaded during the first stage, and proceeded with another branch of visitor validation and the second stage. \\nThis other branch loaded scripts from root20system20macosxdriver.serveusers[.]com, and leveraged https://loginwebmailnic.dynssl[.]com/part/mac/contentmc.php URL to validate targets. The host and validation page names suggest this other branch may have been specifically targeting MacOS users, but we were unable to confirm this hypothesis.',\n",
       "  '2nd JavaScript stage\\nThe second JavaScript stage is named (script|jquery)-file.js, and is obfuscated with Sojson version 5 (see Fig. 5).\\nFig. 5. Nerve-breaking one-line obfuscation.\\nThe payload leverages jquery.fileDownload to show a modal pop-up to the target. It offers visitors an update to Flash Player. No technical vulnerabilities are exploited: the threat actor relies on the target’s willingness to keep their system up to date. The deobfuscated JavaScript payload (see Fig. 6) reveals that the malicious update is hosted on GitHub.\\nFig. 6. Malicious update source in second JavaScript payload.\\nGitHub FlashUpdate repository\\nThe pop-up links to a PE executable hosted on github[.]com/AdobeFlash32/FlashUpdate. GitHub disabled this repository on February 14 after we reported it to them. However, the repository has been online for more than nine months, and thanks to GitHub’s commit history (see Fig. 7), we gained a unique insight into the attacker’s activity and tools.\\nFig. 7.

The implant probably leverages the gdrive Go source from GitHub, as it shares several identical code source paths with it.\\nGodlike12 is the name the threat actor gave to the Google Drive space connections from this implant. Source file paths in the code suggest this backdoor may have been developed on a GNU/Linux system. The not-so-common (less than 100 results in a popular search engine) /root/gowork GOPATH that some of this backdoor’s modules have been compiled from seems popular in Chinese-speaking communities, and may originate from a Chinese-authored tutorial on Go language.\\nGodlike12 first proceeds with host fingerprinting upon startup (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows version, current time). The result is encrypted, base64-encoded, stored in a text file at %TEMP%/[ID]-lk.txt, and uploaded to the remote Google Drive. The implant then regularly checks for a remote [ID]-cs.txt, that contains encrypted commands to execute, and stores encrypted command results in %TEMP%/[ID]-rf.txt to later upload them to the same Google Drive space. ID is the MD5 hash of the base64-encoded MAC address of the first connected network adapter, while TripleDES in ECB mode is used as an encryption algorithm. It is worth mentioning that once again, the encryption function seems to have been inspired from existing open-source code, which mainly appears popular in Chinese-language forums.\\nGodlike12 does not implement a persistence mechanism, as it is provided by the previous installer package. It is detected by Kaspersky endpoint protection heuristics as  HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic. \\nWith this implant being a month old at the time of writing (while being in use since at least October 2019), and other malicious update implants having been used before, it is possible that Godlike12-based operations were still a work in progress when we investigated them.\\nModified Stitch Python backdoor\\n\\nMD5\\nEC993FF561CBC175953502452BFA554A',\n",

The toolset that’s being used seems low-budget and not fully developed, but has been modified several times in a few months to leverage interesting features like Google Drive C2, and would be characteristic of a small, agile team.\\nWe were unable to observe any live operations, but some tracks indicate that the Godlike12 backdoor is not widespread, and is probably used to conduct reconnaissance and data-exfiltration operations. \\nWe were unable to correlate these attacks to any known APT groups.\\nFor more details and the latest information on this threat actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nAppendix – IOCs\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nDomain\\nIP address\\nDescription\\n\\nroot20system20macosxdriver.serveusers[.]com\\n45.32.154[.]111\\nWatering hole targets validator server\\n\\nloginwebmailnic.dynssl[.]com\\n207.148.117[.]159\\nWatering hole targets validator server',\n",

       "  'For more than three years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of.\\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2020.\\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com‘.\\nThe most remarkable findings\\nOn May 11, the UK-based supercomputing center, ARCHER, announced that it would shut down access to its network while it investigated a security incident. The website stated that the “ARCHER facility is based around a Cray XC30 supercomputer (with 4920 nodes) that provides the central computational resource”. At the same time, the German-based bwHPC also announced a security incident and decided to restrict access to its resources. The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, at the time involved in a project to study the small membrane protein of the coronavirus, confirmed that it, and other European high-performance computer facilities, had been attacked and that it had temporarily closed. On May 15, the EGI Computer Security and Incident Response Team (EGI-CSIRT) published an alert covering two incidents that, according to its report, may or may not be related. Both incidents describe the targeting of academic data centers for “CPU mining purposes”. The alert includes a number of IoCs, which complement other OSINT (open-source intelligence) observations. Although we weren’t able to establish with a high degree of certitude that the ARCHER hack and the incidents described by EGI-CSIRT are related, we suspect they might be. Some media speculated that all these attacks might be related to COVID-19 research being carried out at the supercomputing centers.',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, last July 16th 2020, NCSC published an advisory describing malicious activity targeting institutions related to research to find a vaccine for COVID-19. In this case, the malware used in the attacks belongs to a family called WellMess, as originally described by LAC Co back in 2018. Until recently, this malware was not believed to be related to any APT activity. Surprisingly, NCSC attributes this activity to the APT-29 threat actor. However, it does not provide any public proof.\\nFrom our own research, we can confirm that WellMess’s activity seems to follow a cycle, being used in campaigns every three months or so since its discovery. We observed a peak of activity in fall of 2019, followed by an increase in the number of C2s in February 2020. We also observed high-profile targeting, including telcos, government and contractors in MENA and the EU. However, from our side we cannot confirm attribution or targeting of health institutions at the moment.\\nFor more details about WellMess, you can check our presentation from GReAT ideas here: https://youtu.be/xeTYLRCwnFo\\nRussian-speaking activity\\nIn May, researchers at Leonardo published a report about “Penquin_x64”, a previously undocumented variant of Turla’s Penquin GNU/Linux backdoor. Kaspersky has publicly documented the Penquin family, tracing it back to its Unix ancestors in the Moonlight Maze operation of the 1990s. We followed up on this latest research by generating network probes that detect Penquin_x64 infected hosts at scale, allowing us to discover that tens of internet hoster’s servers in Europe and the US are still compromised today. We think it’s possible that, following public disclosure of Turla’s GNU/Linux tools, the Turla threat actor may have been repurposing Penquin to conduct operations other than traditional intelligence.',\n",
       "  'In June, we discovered two different domain names, “emro-who[.]in” and “emro-who[.]org”, typo-squatting the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO). These domains, registered on June 21 using the Njalla.no registrar, seem to be used as sender domains for a spear-phishing campaign. This type of typo-squatting is reminiscent of Sofacy campaigns against other international organizations. Moreover, we have seen Njalla.no recently used to register SPLM and XTUNNEL C2 (command-and-control) servers and we have seen this autonomous system used by Sofacy in the past for a SPLM C2.\\nHades is an elusive, highly dynamic threat actor that commonly engages in tailored hacking and special access operations, such as the OlympicDestroyer attack or the ExPetr (aka NotPetya) and Badrabbit attacks. On May 28, the US National Security Agency (NSA) published an alert detailing the use by Hades of an Exim vulnerability (CVE-2019-10149) for what appears to be a potentially large hacking operation designed for mass access. Our own report expanded on the scripts used in this operation, as well as providing other IoCs that we discovered.\\nChinese-speaking activity\\nIn late 2019, and again in March this year, we described ongoing malicious activities from a previously unknown threat actor that we named Holy Water. Holy Water notably leveraged a Go language and Google Drive-command-driven implant that we dubbed Godlike12. Following the publication of our report, and notifications to relevant incident response organizations, new Holy Water samples were submitted to VirusTotal. The newly discovered samples include Telegram-controlled and open-source-based Python implants that were probably deployed on the victim’s networks after a successful intrusion.',\n",
       "  'In March, one of our YARA rules from previous research on ShadowPad attacks detected a recently compiled executable file uploaded to VirusTotal. Later we found a few other samples from our own telemetry. ShadowPad is a modular attack platform consisting of a root module and various plugin modules responsible for diverse functionalities. ShadowPad was first discovered by Kaspersky in 2017. In August of that year, one of our customers detected suspicious network activities. After thorough investigation, we found a legitimate software module that had been compromised and backdoored by an advanced threat actor in a sophisticated software supply-chain attack. We notified the software vendor and also published the outcome of our investigations in a technical white paper. Since then, ShadowPad malware has been deployed in a number of major cyberattacks, with a different subset of plugins used in different attack cases: the CCleaner incident in 2017 and the ShadowHammer attacks in 2018 are the major examples of such attacks.\\nWhen analyzing new samples from ShadowPad malware, compiled and used in attacks since late 2019, our investigation revealed a strong connection between these recent ShadowPad malware samples and the CactusPete threat actor. CactusPete started deploying ShadowPad malware to a few victims at the beginning of 2019 through its HighProof backdoor. However, since late 2019, ShadowPad has been commonly used in CactusPete attacks.\\nThis quarter, we described another CactusPete attack campaign which started in December 2019 In this campaign, the CactusPete threat actor used a new method to drop an updated version of the DoubleT backdoor onto the computers. The attackers implanted a new dropper module in the Microsoft Word Startup directory, most likely through a malicious document. This malicious dropper is responsible for dropping and executing a new version of the DoubleT backdoor, which utilizes a new method of encrypting the C2 server address.',\n",
       "  'While analysing compromised machines in Central Asia, we revealed an additional infection that was unrelated to the initial subject of our investigation. This led us to detect previously unknown malware that we dubbed B&W, which provides an attacker with the capabilities to remotely control a victim’s machine. Further analysis of the samples, infrastructure and other related artefacts allowed us to conclude, with medium confidence, that the newly found malware is related to the SixLittleMonkeys APT. This group is known to have been active for several years, targeting government entities in Central Asia.\\nHoneyMyte is an APT threat actor that we have been tracking for several years. In February, our fellow researchers at Avira blogged about HoneyMyte PlugX variants that they had recently observed targeting Hong Kong. PlugX has been used by multiple APT groups over the past decade, especially shared among Chinese-speaking threat actors, and has changed in many ways. Avira´s post covers the PlugX loader and backdoor payload, including its USB capabilities. In May, we published an update on this threat actor, specifically providing timely indicators to aid in threat hunting for some of the PlugX variants found in the wild between January and May this year.\\nIn May, we discovered a watering hole on the website of a Southeast Asian top official. This watering hole, set up in March, seemed to leverage allowlisting and social engineering techniques to infect its targets. The final payload was a simple ZIP archive containing a readme file prompting the victim to execute a CobaltStrike implant. The mechanism used to execute CobaltStrike was DLL side-loading, which decrypted and executed a CobaltStrike stager shellcode. Analysis of the code, the infrastructure and the victimology led us to attribute this watering-hole, with high confidence, to the HoneyMyte APT threat actor.',\n",
       "  'Quarian is a little-known malicious program that Chinese-speaking actors have used since around 2012. We hadn’t spotted any further activity until we observed a resurgence in an attack by the Icefog group in 2019. We tracked the activity of the malware following this and noticed a new variant that was used during several attacks on Middle Eastern and African governments during 2020. In one case, we could see that this variant was deployed following exploitation of the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability on the network of a government entity. This vulnerability, which was publicly reported in February 2020, allows an authenticated user to run commands as SYSTEM on a Microsoft Exchange server. In this case, the server was indeed compromised and was hosting the ChinaChopper webshell, which was used to obtain, and later launch, the Quarian and PlugX backdoors. Our analysis led us to assume, with medium to high confidence, that the group behind these attacks is one we track under the name CloudComputating – a Chinese-speaking actor that, based on previous reports, has targeted high-profile Middle Eastern diplomatic targets.\\nIn March, researchers at Check Point Research published a report describing an APT campaign that targeted Mongolia’s public sector and leveraged a coronavirus-themed lure to conduct its initial intrusion. We were able to discover further samples and another COVID-themed document with the same targeting, as well as additional targets in Russia. We attribute this activity with medium confidence to IronHusky.\\nMiddle East\\nThe MuddyWater APT was discovered in 2017 and has been active in the Middle East ever since. In 2019, we reported activity against telecoms providers in Iraq and Iran, as well as government bodies in Lebanon. We recently discovered MuddyWater using a new C++ toolchain in a new wave of attacks in which the actor leveraged an open-source utility called Secure Socket Funneling for lateral movement.',\n",
       "  'At the end of May, we observed that Oilrig had included the DNSExfitrator tool in its toolset. It allows the threat actor to use the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol. Use of the DNS protocol for malware communications is a technique that Oilrig has been using for a long time. The difference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain text requests to port 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. Oilrig added the publicly available DNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows DoH queries to Google and Cloudflare services. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVID-related domain which are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples.\\nSouthеast Asia and Korean Peninsula\\nBlueNoroff is one of the most prolific financially motivated APT actors and we have published several reports of BlueNoroff campaigns targeting financial institutions. Recently, we uncovered another campaign that has been active since at least 2017. In this campaign, the group sends spear-phishing emails containing an archived Windows shortcut file. The file names are disguised as security or cryptocurrency related files in order to entice users into executing them. The infection chain started from this shortcut file is a complex multi-stage infection procedure. Before delivering the Windows executable payload, the actor uses two VBS and three PowerShell scripts in order to collect system information. The actor very carefully delivers the final payload only to the intended targets. The backdoor payload also utilizes a multi-stage infection procedure. The actor uses it to control infected hosts and implants additional malware for surveillance. These malicious programs are responsible for stealing the user’s keystrokes and saving a screenshot of the infected machine. The main targets of this campaign are financial institutions, such as cryptocurrency businesses, and fintech companies. We identified diverse victims from 10 countries, as well as more potential victims from open source intelligence.',\n",
       "  'The Lazarus group has been a major threat actor for several years. Alongside goals like cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage, this threat actor has targeted banks and other financial companies around the globe. The group continues to be very active. We recently observed the Lazarus group attacking a software vendor in South Korea using Bookcode, malware that we evaluate to be a Manuscrypt variant, utilizing a watering-hole attack to deliver it. Manuscrypt is one of the Lazarus group’s tools that is actively being updated and used. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising this victim, Lazarus attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool, but failed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying various freeware and red-teaming tools used. Although Lazarus has recently tended to focus more on targeting the financial industry, we believe that in this campaign they were seeking to exfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread Bookcode using a decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector. Based on our observations, we evaluate that the Bookcode malware is being used exclusively for cyber-espionage campaigns.\\nIn April, we released an early warning about the VHD ransomware, which was first spotted in late March. This ransomware stood out because of its self-replication method. The use of a spreading utility compiled with victim-specific credentials was reminiscent of APT campaigns, but at the time we were unable to link the attack to an existing group. However, Kaspersky was able to identify an incident in which the VHD ransomware was deployed, in close conjunction with known Lazarus tools, against businesses in France and Asia. This indicates that Lazarus is behind the VHD ransomware campaigns that have been documented so far. As far as we know, this is also the first time it has been established that the Lazarus group has resorted to targeted ransomware attacks for financial gain.',\n",
       "  'Last year we created a private report on a malware framework that we named MATA, which we attribute, with low confidence, to the Lazarus group. This framework included several components, such as a loader, orchestrator and plug-ins. Initially, this framework targeted Windows and Linux. However, in April we discovered a suspicious macOS file uploaded to VirusTotal using a rule to detect the MATA malware framework. After looking into this malware, we confirmed that it was a macOS variant of the MATA malware. The malware developers Trojanized an open-source two-factor authentication application and utilized another open-source application template. While investigating, to find more solid evidence for attribution, we found an old Manuscrypt strain that used a similar configuration structure. We also discovered a cluster of C2 servers probably related to this campaign.\\nThe MATA framework was not the only way that Lazarus targeted macOS. We also observed a cluster of activity linked to Operation AppleJeus. The other was similar to the macOS malware used in a campaign that we call TangDaiwbo. This is a multi-platform cryptocurrency exchange campaign: Lazarus utilizes macro-embedded Office documents and spreads PowerShell or macOS malware, depending on the victim’s system.\\nEarly this year, we reported improvements in a Lazarus campaign targeting a cryptocurrency business. In this campaign, Lazarus adopted a downloader that sends compromised host information and selectively fetches the next-stage payload. Recently, we identified a Lazarus campaign with similar strategies, but targeting academic and automotive sectors. Lazarus also adopted new methods to deliver its tools. First of all, the group elaborated its weaponized document by adopting remote template injection techniques. Previously, Lazarus delivered macro-embedded documents to the victim, but the group has now applied one more stage to hinder detection. The group also utilized an open-source PDF reader named Sumatra PDF to make Trojanized applications. They created a Trojanized PDF reader, sending it to the victim with a crafted PDF file. If the victim opens this file, the Trojanised PDF viewer implants malicious files and shows decoy documents to deceive the victim. The actor delivers the final payload very carefully, and executes it in memory. Fortunately, we were able to get the final payload and confirm that it was a Manuscrypt variant that we had already described. We also found that it’s the same malware variant that the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) recently reported, named COPPERHEDGE.',\n",
       "  'Following our report describing the long-standing PhantomLance campaign in Southeast Asia, we published a private report providing detailed attribution based on discovered overlaps with reported campaigns of the OceanLotus APT. In particular, we found multiple code similarities with the previous Android campaign, as well as similarities in macOS backdoors, infrastructure overlap with Windows backdoors and a couple of cross-platform resemblances. Based on our research, we believe, with medium confidence, that PhantomLance is a modern Android campaign conducted by OceanLotus. Apart from the attribution details, we described the actor’s spreading strategy using techniques to bypass app market filters. We also provided additional details about samples associated with previously reported suspected infrastructure, as well as the latest sample deployed in 2020 that uses Firebase to decrypt its payload.\\nAdditionally, OceanLotus has been using new variants of its multi-stage loader since the second half of 2019. The new variants use target-specific information (username, hostname, etc.) of the targeted host that they obtained beforehand, in order to ensure their final implant is deployed on the right victim. The group continues to deploy its backdoor implant, as well as Cobalt Strike Beacon, configuring them with updated infrastructure.\\nOther interesting discoveries\\nThe Deceptikons APT is a long-running espionage group believed to have been providing mercenary services for almost a decade now. The group is not technically sophisticated and has not, to our knowledge, deployed zero-day exploits. The Deceptikons infrastructure and malware set is clever, rather than technically advanced. It is also highly persistent and in many ways reminds us of WildNeutron. Deceptikon’s repeated targeting of commercial and non-governmental organizations is somewhat unusual for APT actors. In 2019, Deceptikons spear-phished a set of European law firms, deploying PowerShell scripts. As in previous campaigns, the actor used modified LNK files requiring user interaction to initially compromise systems and execute a PowerShell backdoor. In all likelihood, the group’s motivations included obtaining specific financial information, details of negotiations, and perhaps even evidence of the law firms’ clientele.',\n",
       "  'MagicScroll (aka AcidBox) is the name we’ve given to a sophisticated malware framework, whose main purpose is to decrypt and load an arbitrary payload in kernel mode. The framework consists of several stages. The first stage is a Windows security provider that is loaded by the system on boot and executed in user mode. This decrypts and runs a second payload, which is physically stored in the registry. Although we weren’t able to find a victim with this second stage, we were able to find a file that matches the expected format of the second stage. This second stage payload utilizes a well-known vulnerability in a VirtualBox driver (CVE-2008-3431) to load the third stage, which is designed to run in kernel mode. The kernel mode payload is decrypted from a resource from the second stage, using the key retrieved from the registry. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a decryption key to decrypt the third stage payload, so we don’t know what the last part of this malware framework looks like. Although the code is quite sophisticated, we couldn’t identify any similarity with other known frameworks.\\nAarogya Setu is the name of a mandatory COVID-19 mobile tracking app developed by the National Informatics Centre, an organization that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in India. It allows its users to connect to essential health services in India. With cyber criminals and APT actors taking advantage of pandemic-tracking applications to distribute Trojanized mobile apps, we investigated and identified apps that mimic the appearance and behavior of the legitimate Aarogya Setu app while deploying Android RATs. We consider one of these to be a new version of a RAT that we previously reported being used by the Transparent Tribe threat actor.\\nFinal thoughts\\nThe threat landscape isn’t always full of “groundbreaking” events.\\xa0 However, a review of the activities of APT threat actors indicates that there are always interesting developments. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight these key developments.\\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2020.',\n",
       "  'Geo-politics remains an important motive for some APT threat actors, as shown in the activities of MuddyWater, the compromise of the Middle East Eye website and the campaigns of CloudComputating and HoneyMyte groups.\\nAs is clear from the activities of Lazarus and BlueNoroff, financial gain is another driver for some threat actors – including the use of ransomware attacks.\\nWhile Southeast Asia continues to be an active region for APT activities, this quarter we have also observed heavy activity by Chinese-speaking groups, including ShadowPad, HoneyMyte, CactusPete, CloudComputating and SixLittleMonkeys.\\nAPT threat actors continue to exploit software vulnerabilities – examples this quarter include Hades and MagicScroll.\\nWe have noted before that the use of mobile implants is no longer a novelty, and this quarter is no exception, as illustrated by the PhantomLance campaign.\\nIt is clear that APT actors, like opportunistic cybercriminals, continue to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic as a theme to lure potential victims. However, we would note once again that this doesn’t represent a shift in TTPs.\\n\\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\\n\\nAPT\\nBackdoor\\nChinese-speaking cybercrime\\nFinancial malware\\nLazarus\\nMalware\\nRansomware\\nRussian-speaking cybercrime\\nTargeted attacks\\nTurla\\n\\nAuthors\\n\\nGReAT\\n\\nAPT trends report Q2 2020 \\n Your email address will not be published.

       "  Document(page_content='Perhaps the most predominant attack we researched in this quarter was the SolarWinds attack. SolarWinds showed once again how successful a supply-chain attack can be, especially where attackers go the extra mile to remain hidden and maintain persistence in a target network. The scope of this attack is still being investigated as more zero-day flaws are discovered in SolarWinds products.\\nAnother critical wave of attacks was the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange zero-day vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors. We recently discovered another campaign using these exploits with different targeting, possibly related to the same cluster of activities already reported.\\nLazarus group’s bold campaign targeting security researchers worldwide also utilized zero-day vulnerabilities in browsers to compromise their targets. Their campaigns used themes centered on the use of zero-days to lure relevant researchers, possibly in an attempt to steal vulnerability research.\\n\\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\\n\\nAPT\\nChinese-speaking cybercrime\\nLazarus\\nMalware Technologies\\nMicrosoft\\nMuddyWater\\nRussian-speaking cybercrime\\nSpyware\\nSunburst\\nTargeted attacks\\nTurla\\nVulnerabilities and exploits\\nZero-day vulnerabilities\\n\\nAuthors\\n\\nGReAT\\n\\nAPT trends report Q1 2021 \\n Your email address will not be published.
